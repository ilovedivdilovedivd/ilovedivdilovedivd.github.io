<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>You decide what you want with the nose job. A competent surgeon will listen to you and plan a surgery aimed at accomplishing your goals. Computerized imaging will help with your decision. You can achieve the results given. It can be done with a closed rhinoplasty and this will give a natural look.  (David Alessi, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In fact, producing an “untouched” appearance while addressing your wishes are the goals at the heart of facial plastic surgery. A well performed nose job would produce your desired results.</p><p>While most patients prefer to have their nasal hump removed, this is a personal choice. I would recommend you have an open approach nose job. This provides the best visualization of the tip structures and excellent control over tip refinement.</p><p>By thickness of the bridge do you mean its width? If so that is manageable but not much can be done for the thickness of the nasal skin in that area.</p><p>The nasal tip skin can be thinned out some. Another very important issue to consider is your breathing. A conservative nose job can produce your desired results. Consult a plastic/facial plastic surgeon in your area. (Masoud Saman, MD, )</p><p>I think what you are asking for is absolutely realistic. I always recommend operating on the more conservative side and keeping natural looks.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2654" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0297449e47bc5b26dc0b885dffcb9392">

</div><p>I would recommend consulting in person with a nose job surgeon who can use computer imaging to make sure you are on the same page as far as expected outcomes.  (David Reinstadler, MD, Newport Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Conservative nose job</h3><p>You have every right to establish your own goals for nose job and in your case should not have any problems finding an experienced surgeon who will work with you. Requests like yours make this operation so fascinating to a surgeon. In 35+ years I’ve never done 2 noses exactly the same. You’re right, your pictures are not very helpful; I suggest you send more pictures or consult with a rhinoplasty expert. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Go on a few consults and I think things will be clearer to you once you see a few surgeons. I get that you want a worthwhile improvement but still look natural.</p><p>When you find the surgeon who is right for you, you will know it. You will need to trust your instincts to choose the right surgeon. (Ronald J. Edelson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Goals</h3><p>One of my main concerns when I hear of similar goals from prospective patients is that the patient is conflicted about the desire to change the appearance of their nose and the need to conceal any possibility of someone knowing they had a rhinoplasty.</p><p>Unless it gets resolved, this situation will lead to an unhappy patient after surgery, because there is no outcome that would be acceptable. In general, photographic morphing tools provide an excellent way for the patient to communicate goals and for the doctor to establish treatment options.</p><p>I think it would beneficial for you to do this so that you can actually see for yourself how you’ll look with the changes you think you want. A decision can then be made by your prospective surgeon and yourself whether it would be wise to move forward. (Gerald Minniti, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Communitcation and imaging help acheive rhinoplasty goals</h3><p>You can definitely choose to have a conservative rhinoplasty and retain some of your hump. The key is to make sure you and your surgeon are on the same page. Typically doing computer imaging before surgery is very helpful.</p><p>If the surgeon simulates a result that is too “done” for your tastes, you can communicate that and the two of you can alter the image until it matches your ideal. This does not guarantee your result, but at least now the surgeon understands what he it trying to create.</p><p>This hopefully prevents the situation where the surgeon loves the result, but you feel it is too done. It is also helpful to look at before and after photos of other noses the surgeon has done.</p><p>Often patients are reluctant to have photos on the internet, but most surgeons have several examples photos in their office that they can show you. (David Magilke, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The goal of a rhinoplasty is to refine your existing nose – not create someone else’s. With that being said, a “perfect” feminine nose has certain characteristics that differentiate it from a male nose.</p><p>I recommend consulting with a Board-Certified plastic surgeon who will accurately examine your nose, create a simulation based on what your nose could look like after surgery, and develop a plan tailored to your needs and wishes. (John Layke, DO, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Am I being unrealistic in wanting an extremely conservative rhinoplasty</h3><p>No, you are not being unrealistic at all! Many patients want a very subtle change. Be sure to find a surgeon who performs a lot of rhinoplasty surgery and discuss everything with him/her. (Francis R. Palmer, III, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Conservative hump removal rhinoplasty</h3><p>The bridge of the nose is composed of both bone and cartilage and can be conservatively shaved down. Osteotomies of the nasal bones will then be required. The bulbous tip can also be addressed with a conservative cartilage removal.</p><p>Computer imaging and good communication with your rhinoplasty surgeon can accomplish your goals of a conservative hump removal. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Conservative rhinoplasty</h3><p>Yours is not a bizarre request- we sometimes consult with patients who want to keep a bump or don’t want to touch the tip, etc. In our experience, many of those patients are motivated partly from a place of fear of looking different as much as actually liking the hump or the particular feature of their noses.</p><p>A good percentage of these patients who decide to make such a change come back after a year wishing they had removed more of the bump. So, I don’t want to dissuade you from your aesthetic – it’s your nose and your aesthetic should rule the day. But, it is helpful to explore your aesthetic with your surgeon doing computer imaging to make sure that you have a very clear sense of how a particular change such as reducing a bulbous tip will affect every other part of your nose.</p><p>That way you can move forward being comfortable in your aesthetic goals and knowing that this is what you truly had in mind. A ‘natural, untouched’ appearance doesn’t always mean minimal change. A more dramatic change can look perfectly natural if it’s the right change for that person, and only you can decide for certain what that is for you. (Jason Litner, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
