Our initial 5 years of training in head, nose, and neck surgery followed by our additional training in facial plastic surgery fellowships, which often focus on cosmetic rhinoplasty exclusively, make us experts in the latest rhinoplasty techniques that not only correct cosmetic problems but also restore breathing, while maintaining structure and function.</p><p>Having said that, there are numerous excellent general plastic surgeons that focus on rhinoplasty. Board certification is important as well as your general level of comfort and trust in the doctor. I strive to establish trust and rapport with all of my patients. (Parker A. Velargo, MD, New Orleans Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best thing for you to do is plenty of research and several consults. Experience is extremely important. Also make sure you get to see a lot of photos of each surgeons work.</p><p>There are many surgeons who are excellent at rhinoplasty. The above mentioned steps will help you narrow your search. (Ronald J. Edelson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>You must do your Homework to choose the best nose surgeon</h3><p>Your question about how to pick a nose surgeon is an extremely important one. As you already alluded to it’s a personal decision and one that you may not want to share with friends as far as who to choose or use. That being said it requires a lot of research and there multiple facets to examine when making this decision.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_618" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The first point to be addressed is the training and certification of the surgeon. It is extremely important to choose someone who has extensive formalized training for this procedure.</p><p>Preferably someone who has been trained and is Board Certified in Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) surgery, and also has subsequent facial plastic surgery training is ideal. The nose not only is a structure of beauty but also one of function, and the worst thing to do is have a rhinoplasty that turns out looking good but you can’t breathe well through as a result.</p><p>Nothing is guaranteed with this procedure but choosing someone who understands not only its aesthetic appearance but also its function is extremely important, and having grounded formalized years of training to understand the basics of this is extremely important.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_619" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The second point to consider is someone who had plastic surgeon training with a high volume of rhinoplasties in the program. Plastic Surgery training varies widely on its focus (i.e. face, body, burns, craniofacial/pediatric, etc…) depending on where the surgeon trained, and who they trained under.</p><p>Some training programs are much more heavily weighted towards reconstruction or perhaps surgery on structures other than the nose, so it’s important to inquire into that as well when initially meeting your surgeon, or researching him or her ahead of time.</p><p>The third point to consider is volume of surgery since their training, i.e.: their personal experience. Rhinoplasty is a very humbling procedure even for surgeons with years of experience and high volume/year. It truly is a procedure that continues to teach the surgeon nuances throughout their career.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_620" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-05d5972330a5ce9da40cb071f12d1b9e">

<meta itemprop="height" content="200">
<amp-img class="size-medium wp-image-620 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Best-nose-surgeon-result-140x200.jpg" alt="Best nose surgeon result" width="140" height="200" layout="fixed"></amp-img></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Best nose surgeon result</p>
</div><p>Noses have different levels of challenges, or another way to look at it is no two noses are alike as you can see just from looking at those around you. What the translation of this is that since no two noses are alike, no two rhinoplasties are alike either, and therefore a surgeon gains judgment and skill from EVERY nose he operates on.</p><p>Over the years this yields a better understanding of the nuances of rhinoplasty. Some of the simpler noses can be done by someone who doesn’t have much experience, but the majority of them require much more knowledge and skill gained from a healthy volume not only on a yearly basis, but also over many years.</p><p>The next point would be to see rhinoplasty results of that surgeon. It is important to note that those post-operative photographs are preferentially a year out since swelling can hide subtle nuances that aren’t visible during the first couple months post operatively.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_621" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You should expect to see many different rhinoplasty results which will reflect the surgeon having significant breadth of experience, since it is rare for most patients to give permission to use their photos, since pictures of the nose definitely identify the patient by their face. Another important point to consider is where the surgery will be performed.</p><p>Nose surgery should be performed in an accredited facility and preferentially performed under general anesthesia so that the airway is protected. Otherwise, during the procedure there can be the potential for some blood to trickle down the back of the throat and can cause problems with the patient’s airway. If the airway isn’t protected by the use of an endotracheal tube, the blood in the back of the throat/on the vocal cords can result in the patient moving or coughing during this delicate procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_622" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-f4830b7b0699a1317eabc0b216d26a4b">

</div><p>Therefore, consider not only the accreditation of the facility but what type of anesthesia will be used by that surgeon. Last and equally important is your trust with the surgeon. If you search on the Internet about rhinoplasty you will learn that there is also something called revision rhinoplasty.</p><p>Any surgeon worth his wait that does significant volumes of rhinoplasty will have to “touch up” (also known as revision rhinoplasty) of some of their own patients. The rate varies widely as far as what a revision rate is for a surgeon depending on again their volume and years of experience as well as their skill and judgment. When doing a consultation it is reasonable to ask what the surgeons revision rate is. If the surgeon tells you zero you should run, not walk, because that is not being honest and accurate for anybody who performs this procedure, and aspires to obtain an excellent result for their patients.</p><p>A surgeon who has a revision rate below 5 percent with a reasonable volume of yearly rhinoplasty would be a great place to start. It’s important to understand how a surgeon handles a revision financially, should you require a revision of his surgery. This should be an honest and open discussion and goes back to the beginning of this point in that you should have full trust in the physician that will be performing your surgery. Should the situation arise that there is something that needs to be touched up, you need to feel comfortable bringing it up as well as knowing ahead of time the surgeon’s protocol in dealing with this. (Burke Robinson, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Rhinoplasty is one of the most, if not the most, difficult cosmetic surgery to perform. I know asking friends is sometimes uncomfortable; however, asking someone about their experience often will give you insight into the things you should think about for yourself.</p><p>Obviously ask about the education level of your doctor. Additionally, try to understand whether your doctor has a firm grasp of the functional and cosmetic aspects of a rhinoplasty (after all, you need to breathe after surgery).</p><p>Looking at before and after photos is important. However, using imaged photos of your nose is a good way to see if you and your doctor are “on the same page”. (Sandy Sule, MD, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding the best rhinoplasty doctors</h3><p>The best way to go about this is to research plastic dorctors that have rhinoplasty as their top procedure. Look at patient reviews online and see what others experience has been and if they are satisfied. The next step is to schedule a consultation to better understand what they think should be done with your nose and if that meets your goals and expectations. (Michael T. Somenek, MD, FACS, Washington DC Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to find the “best” rhinoplasty doctors</h3><p>I agree with many of the experts answers to this question, and they include a lot of information which I won’t repeat. This can get overwhleming and confusing. Once you are confident that your doctor has the expertise to perform the surgery, keep in mind that your gut can tell you a lot.</p><p>If something doesn’t “feel” right about the doctor or the office or the staff, trust your instincts and investigate further.</p><p>This is a big decision and you need to have a good relationship with your surgeon and trust that he or she will take care of you honestly, ethically, and with the highest standard of care and respect. (Michelle Spring, MD, Missoula Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to choose the best doctor for your procedure</h3><p>Choosing a doctor for your rhinoplasty is a very important first step. First, make sure that the surgeon is board-certified in plastic surgery. Then focus on reputation.</p><p>Word-of-mouth is the best feedback, as you will hear directly from patients who have been treated by that surgeon and see the results first hand. If you want to keep things private, on-line reviews can be helpful, but keep in mind that they are less accurate than speaking with patients directly.</p><p>Find a doctor that performs the procedure often and is known for achieving good rhinoplasty results. In the field of cosmetic surgery, experience counts! Lastly, choose a surgeon with which you feel a connection. someone who is honest and will take the time to explain to you the procedure, its risks and complications. Someone you can trust. (Karl Schwarz, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Selecting a doctor</h3><p>My suggestion is to select a doctor whom you feel comfortable with, one who is able to show you multiple before and after photos of patients with concerns similar to yours.Also, one resource is the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery website which lists doctorss in your area. (Anand G. Shah, MD, San Antonio Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Seek out a rhinoplasty specialist</h3><p>That is a very good question. It is a question that applies to finding any professional who provides specialized services. Initially I would recommend you search your area for a surgeon who is trained in ENT and Facial Plastic Surgery, or plastic surgery.</p><p>Furthermore try and get a sense from their website and from their staff if they truly specialize in cosmetic Rhinoplasty. Many surgeons who offer a wide range of services tend to spend the majority of their time performing body surgeries. Rhinoplasty is a complex challenging surgery which requires specialized skills and experience.</p><p>A consultation should include a thorough explanation of the surgery and ample before and after photos to assure you that the surgeon achieves results that you feel look good. Furthermore Computer imaging has been available for many years and really should be part of a modern Rhinoplasty consult. The link below is to an article that provides some great tips about how to identify a rhinoplasty specialist. The video explains the importance of the pre surgical consultation – which is in my opinion the most important part of the rhinoplasty process (second only to the surgery itself). (Thomas Buonassisi, MD, Vancouver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>You can go on the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. In your city there must be a great Surgeon with lots of rhinoplasty experience. (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Get referrals from friends and doctors and make sure your doctor is board certified. Also ask how many rhinoplasties they do a year. Finally, look at before/after pictures to see if you like their work. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to Find Best Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>It is very important that you find a surgeon who understands both the aesthetic (cosmetic) aspects as well as functional (plastic and reconstructive) aspects. I recommend choosing a facial plastic surgeon who specializes in nasal surgery.</p><p>Ask plenty of questions and look through before and after pictures of rhinoplasties they have performed to ensure you have the same goals. (Carlo Honrado, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding the best rhinoplasty doctor for you</h3><p>The best plastic surgeon/rhinoplasty doctor is the one that will give you the results that you desire with the comfort and support that makes your rhinoplasty journey less anxious.</p><p>To do so I would look at board certified plastic surgeons with experience in doing rhinoplasty procedures, that can show you before and after photos that you appreciate, that develops rapport with you, has good reviews, and does not have any medical board complaints. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding the BEST Rhinoplasty Surgeon for Your Nose</h3><p>When searching for the best surgeon for you for this common but highly technical surgery, start with basics: You can get names from other doctors, staff lists at hospitals you trust, or even from the internet ( though the best marketers with the biggest web presence are not always the ideal surgeon for you)</p><p>Review the surgeon credentials before meeting with them – do you trust their medical school and residency and fellowship training institutions? Meet with a few surgeons, and make sure you feel comfortable with the efficiency and orderliness / cleanliness of the office and the kindness/caring nature of the staff and physician. If you get a good feel for the compatability with this surgeon and can communicate your expectations clearly with them , then you are off to a good start. Make sure they have a PASSION for rhinoplasty surgery and have extensive experience.</p><p>Review patient photos, even ask to speak with a former patient if they can arrange it Ask what happens if you do need revision work or are not happy with the outcome. Be sure to investigate the surgical facility adn the anesthesiolgy accredidation as well (Michael Suzman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing a Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>Rhinoplasty surgery is considered to be one of the most difficult procedures performed by plastic surgeons. The procedure requires that the surgeon have multiple skill sets. He or she must be an anatomist, physiologist, psychologist, architect, and engineer.</p><p>Most importantly, the procedure requires that the surgeon be an artist. Many factors must be considered when choosing a rhinoplasty surgeon. These include the surgeon’s experience, reputation, certification, training, and ability to communicate with patients.</p><p>When performing rhinoplasty surgery, the analysis of the problem is critical. The surgeon must look at the nose from multiple perspectives. The nose should be evaluated based on its individual characteristics as well as its relationship with surrounding facial structures. It’s important to achieve facial harmony, balance, and proportion to obtain optimal aesthetic results.</p><p>It’s also important to consider how nasal surgery will interact with the patient’s gender, ethnic background, and nasal physiology. Finally, every patient has unique aesthetic goals and it’s important that these be understood by the surgeon as well. Although this type of analysis is important, the ability of the surgeon to communicate with patients is even more important. For these reasons, several factors should be considered when choosing a rhinoplasty surgeon. These include:</p><ol>
<li>The ability to evaluate and form a treatment plan for your nose</li>
<li>The ability to communicate the game plan so that it’s understandable</li>
<li>The use of computer imaging to help you visualize the proposed endpoint</li>
<li>Before and after pictures to demonstrate prior work</li>
<li>Board Certification</li>
<li>Training</li>
<li>Experience</li>
<li>Reputation Careful evaluation of these parameters should point you in the right direction. Don’t hesitate to get multiple opinions and most importantly, trust your instincts. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</li>
