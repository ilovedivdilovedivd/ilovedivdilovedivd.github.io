It is better to choose your surgeon by reputation and before/after photos than purely by price.</p><p>Try to find someone who you think can meet your expectations. (Roy A. David, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty surgery price</h3><p>The price of aesthetic procedures can vary widely. It can depend on the city that you are in, the cost of the O.R. and anesthesia.</p><p>It us usually predicated on how much time the surgeon needs to spend in the O.R. See a few plastic surgeons before making your selection. Remember that cheap can become very expensive if there is a problem. (Jeffrey Roth, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The Average Surgeon Fee for Rhinoplasty surgery is $4,436.00</h3><p>As with any type of cosmetic surgery, the cost will vary from doctor to doctor and geographic location to geographic location. In some cases, it may vary depending on the degree of rhinoplasty performed. For example, if only the tip needs alteration then there may be a lesser charge than if a full rhinoplasty procedure was performed. Recent statistics published by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery indicate that the average surgeon fee for a rhinoplasty is $4,436.</p><p>This is an average and in some places it may be more and in some places may be less. This fee does not normally include the fee charged by the facility in which the operation is performed.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_210" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-df427de03e6a63b36d5a3a614ab89371">

</div><p>It also does not include anesthesia if an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist is required. In general, rhinoplasty procedures may cost anywhere from $4000 to $20,000. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgery rhinoplasty Ranges from $4,100 to $5,600 in the Midwest</h3><p>Rhinoplasty or a ‘nose job’ refers to the surgery where the bones and cartilage that make up the nose are altered internally to change the external shape. This can involve removal of bone/cartilage, breaking the bone, or grafting cartilage.</p><p>The cost of the procedure can vary depending on the specifics of the procedure that the anatomy of your nose would require to achieve the appearance that you desire.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_212" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-474bed6606b0b2723834c22d95c9930c">

</div><p>In general, a rhinoplasty at our facility in the Midwest would run $4,100 – $5,600. This does vary significantly in different areas of the country and from surgeon to surgeon. The best way to get an exact estimate for your situation would be to go in for a consultation and be evaluated by a board-certified plastic surgeon. (Marie E. Montag, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty surgery cost</h3><p>Rhinoplasty costs average $2500 to $6500 in Cincinnati including surgeon fees, anesthesia, and hospital. Insurance coverage could affect the overall cost. One of the best ways to pick a surgeon is to view the before/after pictures and see if you like their work. Simulation on an imager is also a good way to see potential results. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The cost of rhinoplasty surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_209" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>The cost of rhinoplasty surgery depends on many variables.</p><ol>
<li>The complexity of the surgery. Are you shaving down a bump or also refining the tip of your nose?</li>
<li>Is this a revision surgery? That often costs double as a lot more is involved.</li>
<li>Do you have any breathing issues? Sometimes a portion of the surgery fees can be covered by insurance if it affects your breathing.</li>
<li>Where is the surgery performed? Often in office certified surgical suites will have better pricing than hospitals.</li>
<li>Geography? In New York and California fees tend to be higher.</li>
<li>Who is performing the surgery? Plastic surgeons specializing in rhinoplasty often charge more for their experience and expertise.</li>
</ol><p>This is money well spent as it can cost you twice as much to fix a problem that could have been avoided. (Ran Y. Rubinstein, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Price of rhinoplasty varies on a number of factors</h3><p></p>

</div>The price of a rhinoplasty surgery can vary widely depending on what is needed to perform the surgery, area of the country, and the surgeon. 
<p>On average, a rhinoplasty will cost about 6-8K and will include anesthesia, operating room, and plastic surgeon fees. More complicated rhinoplasty procedures performed by more exclusive plastic surgeons can be upwards of 20K.  (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your nose is perhaps the single most important feature of your face. It is not uncommon for people to feel self conscious about the appearnce of their nose. Rhinoplasty surgery is a procedure to improve the appearance of your nose and restore self confidence. A succesful rhinoplasty begins with a detailed conversation with your plastic surgeon.</p><p>The patients goals and desires are carefully discussed. The most common problems that we correct are a crooked nose, a bump or a droopy tip.</p><p>All of these problems can be corrected with succesful rhinoplasty surgery. Our goal is to give the patient a natural looking nose. We want the result to look like your own nose.just without the problem that bothers you. The operation only takes a few hours and patients are back to work in about 2 weeks.</p><p>The operation costs betweeen $8000 and $12,000. Our patients are delighted in their new look and getting the nose they always dreamed of. (Frank Lista, MD, Sacramento Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Rhinoplasty price is an important factor but choosing the right Dr is much more important. Corrective surgery is much more expensive than getting it done right the first time. My office is always available for questions and consultations. (George T. Boris, MD, FRCS, FACS, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Price for rhinoplasty in Southern California</h3><p>The price for rhinoplasty does vary by state and geographic location. There are traditionally higher costs in big cities due to higher overhead costs, OR fees, etc. Surgeon’s fees can range from $4,000 to $10,000 or more based on the experience, “prestige”, and profile of the surgeon.</p><p>However, prices do not guarantee results. This is the most challenging cosmetic procedure to get “just right” on the face because millimeters make a difference. You must have a surgeon that has an eye for detail and understands how the nose heals with time. Proper planning goes into creating the incisions, removing or building up the structure of the nose underneath the skin.</p><p>Not every plastic surgeon has had significant experience working on the nose and some perform only a few per year. The surgeon you choose should also understand the functional anatomy of the nose because any cosmetic work can lead to breathing problems down the road. So do your homework and choose your surgeon wisely. (Kristina Tansavatdi, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What does Rhinoplasty Price</h3><p>As other physicians have stated, the rhinoplasty price can vary depending on numerous factors, including:</p><ul>
<li>Location: Physicians located in large cities have higher rent and other expenses compared with physicians in smaller cities or rural areas. Therefore, they generally charge more for a cosmetic surgery.</li>
<li>Quote: When you phone in for a quote, some practices quote only the surgeon’s fee, while others quote everything: surgeon’s fee, anesthesia fee, operating room fees, etc. It’s wise to clarify the list of included items when you phone a plastic surgery office to ask about prices.</li>
<li>Complexity: A simple rhinoplasty takes less time than a revision rhinoplasty and, therefore, may cost less. While rhinoplasty price definitely a consideration, the biggest issue, of course, is the quality of the result.</li>
</ul><p>Identifying the most skilled board certified facial plastic surgeon in your area, meeting that surgeon for a consultation, and viewing as many before/after photos as possible is the best approach. To your health & beauty. (Laurence M. Milgrim, MD, Teaneck Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Why Does The Cost of Rhinoplasty Vary?</h3><p>Rhinoplasty price can vary significantly based on the degree of diificulty associated with a particular patient’s nose, as well as, the skill and experience of the surgeon. Each person’s nose is different, requring a custom approach to each patient.</p><p>Some noses require a little refinement, others more advanced techniques. Re-do or revision rhinoplasty are further complicated by the previous surgery and therefore more difficult. Rhinoplasty is a complex operation combing experience and artistry. In choosing a rhionoplasty surgeon look at before and after pictures. Listen to what the surgeon has to say about your nose because he/she may see things or issues that you had not considered.</p><p>Each nose and each rhinoplasty surgeon is different. Rhinoplasty price, while an important consideration, should be secondary to being comfortable with the surgeon and his/her vision for your nose. (Thomas E. Kaniff, MD, FACS, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Nose job costs vary quite a bit across the country. Facility fees and anesthesia need to be considered as well.</p><p>My biggest advice on this topic is to avoid choosing your surgeon based on the price. Make sure you consult with surgeons that do lots of rhinoplasties.</p><p>Nose job, as opposed to other types of plastic surgery, is not something that can be “dabbled in” with success. It is extremely difficult and requires extreme dedication. (Matthew Bridges, MD, Richmond Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>6000-10000 depending on how complicated the procedure is and who is doing it. More complicated procedures by a more experienced surgeon would outnumber a less complicated “primary” nose job.</p><p>First of all, make sure you pick the surgeon you feel comfortable with and understand what and how complicated are the steps they will perform to get you where you want. Then think about the price. (Vartan Mardirossian, MD, Jupiter Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of nose job</h3><p>The cost of nose job surgery will vary by where you are located. The cost of rhinoplasty is one of several factors that should be considered when choosing your surgeon. Experience, training, board certification, and past results are all important aspects to consider.</p><p>While cost is an important factor, excellent surgical results are the most important consideration. (Josh Surowitz, MD, Raleigh-Durham Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Cost</h3><p>Nose job costs vary based on the practice and it can be higher in major metropolitan areas than in rural areas. Surgeons often charge based on what they feel their skills are worth. It is important to select a physician who regularly performs nose job surgery.</p><p>Prices can vary greatly but you can find the average price range in your community on this site, by clicking on the “treatment &gt; rhinoplasty” link above. One thing to keep in mind is that it can be very costly to fix a bad nose job, so getting it right the first time is incredibly important.</p><p>You wouldn’t choose a discount brain surgeon if you needed one, so don’t go for the cheapest deal in town, as you may regret it. A good rhinoplasty takes time in the OR, and sometimes the price is reflective of this OR time/cost.</p><p>Choose your surgeon based on patient reviews, board certification, experience with nose job surgery, and your comfort level with that surgeon. A rhinoplasty can make you feel like a new person and give you the confidence that you deserve. A hasty decision can set you back both financially and emotionally. (Christopher Khorsandi, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job cost can be lot cheaper abroad</h3><p>Medical tourism is increasing. It can be lot more cheaper abroad with good quality care, average. Nose job cost is around 2500$, by experienced. Rhinoplasty surgeon in India by well qualified and experienced surgeon (Brajendra Baser, MS, DNB, India Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job fees are based on many factors</h3><p>The cost of a nose job is based on many factors. Although not guaranteed, a more experienced surgeon may have more predictable results and will probably charge more. This can work out to be more cost effective since in cases where the original result is not what the patient expected, they may require a revision procedure, with added cost. The cost of some nose job procedures can be covered by Provincial Health Insurance plans, this amount and requirements vary from province to province. (Robert Mounsey, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The Cost Varies</h3><p>As with many things you can purchase, nose job cost depends on many factors. The cost of the facility (where you will have your surgery), the cost of anesthesia, and the surgeon’s fee are the three main drivers of cost.</p><p>The facility charge depends on whether the physician owns the surgery center, and the size of the market you live in. Large and small markets tend to have higher facility costs than mid-sized markets.</p><p>The cost of anesthesia usually depends on how long the procedure takes. Finally, the surgeon’s fee often depends on how many rhinoplasties the physician has performed.</p><p>The time of year can also impact the surgeon’s fee. Ask the physician how many procedures she has performed. Rhinoplasties are extremely difficult, so you want to make sure that your physician is highly experienced. Review the physician’s before and after photos, and look to see whether the physician is experienced doing rhinoplasties on people of your ethnicity.</p><p>While it is wise to understand the factors that make up the total cost, you should never choose a physician based solely on cost. (Farhan Taghizadeh, MD, Albuquerque Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much does nose job cost?</h3><p>Costs for a nose job will certainly vary depending on your location. Things to factor in for the rhinoplasty standpoint will be the facility fee, anesthesia fee, surgeon fee, other fees (e.g., splint, materials, etc.). A consultation with a plastic surgeon will help you in determining which procedure(s) would be the right one for you. Cost also depends on the complexity of your case and how much work would need to be done to achieve an aesthetically-pleasing nose for you. Good luck!
