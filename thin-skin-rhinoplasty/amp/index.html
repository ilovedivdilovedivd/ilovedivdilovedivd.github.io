You have excellent structure and thin skin which allows for a very refined and elegant result.</p><p>As has been noted, thin skin will allow for your anatomy to show through, which can be a huge benefit to a well-performed procedure or a problem for a surgeon who does not take meticulous care to ensure symmetry and softening of any edges.</p><p>You have very clear goals and expectations so, in the hands of an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon, you should look forward to a great outcome.</p><p>Because you are essentially looking for some definition and refinement of your tip, your procedure should be relatively straightforward.</p><p>Tip refinement is a relative term. If done with a view towards a natural change, you should not have to worry about looking ‘fake’.</p><p>Likewise, you should not have to pay a higher fee as your procedure would not be considered complicated by most rhinoplasty surgeons. (Jason Litner, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty in Thin skinned individuals</h3><p>Personally, I do NOT think that having thin nasal skin is a liability at all. In fact, it makes our job easier because the skin will reflect the underlying structure. As far as your nose goes if you like the dorsum – ask your surgeon to leave it alone your tip cartilage is NOT “split in half ” it is supposed to be this way.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2729" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-420e61b21d3185c58217fe448ab2df66">

</div><p>The tip is made of a pair of Lower Lateral cartilages. But because of their size, convexity and thinness of your skin you have a BIFID TIP. Your nose is NOT complicated at all and its correction should definitely cost more.</p><p>As far as I am concerned based on your wishes, you may very well be happy with a TIP RHINOPLASTY in which the lower lateral cartilages were reduced in width (Cephalic rim reduction), were sutured closer together with dome spanning sutures (to get a more refined non-bifid tip) and the tip was slightly upward rotated to reduce the mild degree of plunging tip you have (probably worse when you smile) and create a definite supra-tip break (the point where the dorsum stops and tip starts). (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>as a matter of fact your rhinoplasty should be easier because you have thin skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2728" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Your tip cartilages are pushing forward and down, they just need to be resculpted and reshaped to reverse the orientation. The hump is also easily reduce by shaving it down. Consider an open rhinoplasty. (Oleh Slupchynskyj, MD, FACS, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>I love to operate on noses with thin skin</h3><p>This is one area of rhinoplasty that separates the men from the boys. Even though thin skin shows the underlying cartilage structure underneath, including surgical changes, very precise changes can be made and will be visible. So, if the procedure is done correctly the results can be more predictable than thick skin. We even have ways to soften the tip of the nose by using a very thin graft of fascia or extremely thin cartilage that is crushed to create a cushion under the skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2727" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This is akin to putting a padding under a carpet. I suggest you seek out a rhinoplasty specialist. The nose of today should look better but not fixed. By your photograph, you are a very attractive lady and I think a rhinoplasty will enhance your beauty. (Steven J. Pearlman, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Thin skinned rhinoplasty. Be careful with tip grafts.</h3><p>Surgery on a thin-skinned nose can often result in a very elegant result, but it carries with it certain caveats. In particular, since any little contour irregularity will show (and will show more and more over time), any tip grafts need to be absolutely meticulously shaped, tapered, and even “bruised.” Ideally, too, the grafts should be further camouflaged with fascia (connective tissue), AlloDerm, or even some cartilage saved from a cephalic trim.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2730" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b527d53b3c9f8347f60fc0f1d1176e70">

</div><p>Your bifid tip (where you can see the natural cleft between the domes of the tip) could be nicely concealed this way, too. (David C. Pearson, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tip rhinoplasty on thin skin is okay</h3><p>To correct the tip of the nose and improve the tip appearance is a straight forward part of a rhinoplasty. If you only need the tip corrected then you will have a shorter procedure and quicker recovery. Your bridge can stay the same. A tip rhinoplasty is usually less expensive because you are saving time in the operating room. The thin skin means the changes will be seen easily and the surgeon will need to be very precise. Discuss your concerns and goals with your surgeon and make sure both of you are comfortable with the planned procedure. (Marcus L. Peterson, MD, Saint George Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tip rhinoplasty for thin skinned nose is not complex</h3><p>I agree with both previous expert posters, Drs Rand & Aidea. Your request is not complex and a great result can be easily obtained. Go get opinions. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tip rhinoplasty for nose with thin skin</h3><p>A skilled and experienced rhinoplasty surgeon can help you achieve your nasal tip (and overall nasal) goals with a properly performed rhinoplasty with emphasis on your nasal tip.</p><p>Thin skinned patients require exact surgery on their nasal cartilage because the sculpting changes will show through the skin covering.</p><p>After altering your tip, your nose should still have a natural look, just more refined and without the bulbous cartilage split (sometimes affectionately referred to by my patients as the “butt tip”).</p><p>The best way of avoiding a “fake” nose result is by spending time in choosing your rhinoplasty surgeon most carefully. It is not the rhinoplasty operation that creates an operated looking “done” nose, but the surgeon.</p><p>The cost of your surgery should not be more expensive because of your thin skin. (Michael A. Persky, MD, Encino Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tip rhinoplasty and thin skin</h3><p>You can certainly achieve a natural tip with rhinoplasty. The main issue with thin skin is that everything done underneath becomes more obvious.</p><p>However, if you work with an experienced surgeon, you should not have a problem. Having thin skin should not drive up the cost of your surgery. (Nina S. Naidu, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty in thin-skinned patients requires a very skilled surgeon</h3><p>I have seen many noses on thin skinned patients that require a very skilled and experienced rhinoplasty surgeon! This is not simple! In more than 30 years of rhinoplasty experienced I have seen noses that looked good at 1 year and distorted at 5-10 years later.</p><p>I saw noses I did in my training and early in my practice that changed for the worse in thin skinned nose over time. This make me change my technique for these noses dramatically. This corrected the problem and made the noses much better.</p><p>I am doing facelifts on the “girls” I did noses on 25 years ago and have the opportunity to see these noses over time. The cost is the same. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tip Rhinoplasty can have different outcomes with different skin types</h3><p>Surgery to narrow the tip of your nose or to reshape cartilage can be performed without altering your profile if you so desire and can be done leaving the rest of your nose alone. Patients with thicker skinned noses tend to have better camoflauge for any tip irregularities when surgery is done there; however, they often have more of an amorphous or less defined tip.</p><p>Patients with thinner skin can actually get better results from tip surgery and how it looks depends upon your and your surgeon’s preference. You are right in that if too much is done to the tip it can look fake. However, if you simply want it brought into a more symmetrical position and narrowed slightly vis a vis correcting the split that can actually be more easily done in a thinned skin nose. If you want a lot of tip alteration which requires cutting the cartilage at the tip like creating a boxy or upturned tip then it is more risky in thin skinned nose as you can see cartilage irregularities.</p><p>I actually prefer operating on patients with thin skin on the tip especially patient who do not want a created look to the tip as the results are much more predictable. The costs however should be the same and the surgeon should not charge more because of your skin type.  (Scott Trimas, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tip correction Rhinoplasty would give you an excellent result</h3><p>You are a perfect candidate for tip only rhinoplasty. The fact that your tip skin is a little thin is better than if it was thick. That actaully makes the doctor’s job a little easier because as he corrects the shape of the cartilage, he knows the skin will show those changes too. There should not be any additional charge for your nose surgery. (Robert B. Pollack, MD, La Jolla Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
