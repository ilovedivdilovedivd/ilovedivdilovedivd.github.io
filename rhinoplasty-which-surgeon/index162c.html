Not all “cosmetic & plastic surgeons” perform rhinoplasty regularly. Although there are many different boards and surgical organisations, no organisation can guarantee a surgeon’s surgical results. Choose a surgeon who Specializes in Rhinoplasty surgery and performs the surgery every week.</p><p>A surgeon who performs mostly body or breast surgery may be less specialised in rhinoplasty. Rhinoplasty takes considerable experience and training to get predictable results and it is reasonable to ask what proportion of the surgeon’s practice is dedicated to rhinoplasty.</p><p>Experience & Fellowship. Training are important, additional fellowship experience in cosmetic and facial plastic surgery will provide a surgeon with greater knowledge and enable a surgeon to complete more complex surgery.</p><p>Ask to view the Surgeons Rhinoplasty Before & After Photos. All surgeon’s have a particular style and rhinoplasty is a procedure that requires artistic interpretation in addition to surgical technique to give the best possible result.</p><p>Artistic judgement is a key characteristic in giving patients best possible results. Ask to see Patient’s Testimonials from previous patient’s experience, and if it is possible to speak to a patient who has undergone the procedure with the surgeon.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_596" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In addition teaching rhinoplasty, presenting Nationally and Internationally as well as publications in rhinoplasty. The cost of surgery will be influenced by complexity of surgery, time in the operating room, materials required, state-of-art equipment, after care with the surgeon or nursing staff, as well as experience and personalization of the service you receive and by geographic location.</p><p>Medical tourism such as going abroad for surgery is not recommended as research has show that a high proportion of patients are dissatisfied with their surgery. Rhinoplasty is a precise procedure and choosing someone with skills discussed above is generally more important that price alone. (Julian De Silva, MD, Philadelphia Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to find the best rhinoplasty surgeon</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_597" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a93e47936855586b15a8f8c34ed2c8df">

</div><p>This question can be equally applied to any other surgical procedure, and although there is no definitive answer, there are a few guide lines that can help you find a good surgeon.</p><ol>
<li>Training: This is the easiest fact to check. Ensure that the surgeon was trained at a reputable program. Subspecilaty training i.e. fellowship training is important. Facial plastic surgeons may be better trained in rhinoplasty, as they complete an ear, nose and throat residency before starting fellowship.</li>
<li>Board certification: Board certification ensures that the surgeon has completed a set of requirements and passed a test of competency.</li>
<li>Experience: Surgery is one field of medicine in which experience is extremely important. Ask how many rhinoplasties the surgeon performs each year.</li>
<li>Results: Ask to see before and after pictures, and talk to former patients.</li>
<li>Comparisons: Be certain to obtain more than one opinion before embarking on surgery. This will give a chance to compare surgeons not only on their technical abilities, but also on their affability and bedside manner. (Maurice M. Khosh, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>

</div><p>Specialization in rhinoplasty surgery, more than perhaps any other facial plastic surgery procedure, is essential for achieving consistent aesthetic results. These are one of the most challenging procedures, and therefore the patient should choose a surgeon who specializes in this. I always advise my patients to look at the following:</p><ol>
<li>number of cases performed weekly and the years in practice</li>
<li>board certification – surgeons board certified by the American Board of Facial Plastic Surgery are (and I may be biased here) going to be, in GENERAL, the most experienced and well trained in rhinoplasty surgery, but this is not to say that some surgeons certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery are not experienced and proficient in this procedure</li>
<li>lots of photos of before and afters</li>
<li>good communication and listening skills by the surgeon, who also provides computer imaging to help facilitate this process. Doing your homework prior to the procedure will go a very long way to assuring the best possible result. (Jeffrey Epstein, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>How to find the top rhinoplasty surgeon</h3><p>The most important factors to consider in choosing a rhinoplasty surgeon are the surgeon’s training, the extent of their experience and their aesthetic/artistic sense. Facial Plastic Surgeons tend to have more training in nasal surgery then other cosmetic surgeons because of their background in Ear, Nose and Throat.</p><p>They also tend to do many more rhinoplasties then the other practitioners in the cosmetic surgery field because they concentrate on the face. Rhinoplasty is a huge part of what I do, it is not an occasional part of my practice. Many other cosmetic surgeons specialize in breast surgery and liposuction and only rarely will they do a rhinoplasty.</p><p>Finally, I would recommend looking at many before and after photos to get a sense of the surgeon’s outcomes. (Jonathan Pontell, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding The Top rhinoplasty surgeon For You</h3><p>Finding the top rhinoplasty surgeon for your particular desires can and should be a discriminating but worthwhile process.</p><p>There are many factors to consider in choosing the right surgeon, but the following are probably the most important: Board Certification in Facial Plastic Surgery or Plastic Surgery – facial plastic surgeons tend to have board certification in ENT and facial plastic surgery, which means they have more formal training in nose surgery. Therefore, they may offer additional expertise in the area of rhinoplasty. A Subspecialty Focus in Rhinoplasty – there are a lot of plastic surgeons out there but not many that have a particular focus in the area of rhinoplasty and revision rhinoplasty.</p><p>Photo Examples of Rhinoplasty Patients – this gives you an idea of actual surgical outcomes by that particular rhinoplasty surgeon. It gives you a general overview of their esthetic style as well. Many rhinoplasty surgeons have a ‘signature nose’ that they perform.</p><p>Meaning, many of their patients come out looking very similar in terms of the appearance of the nose. Make sure your surgeon’s photo gallery includes many different type of rhinoplasty outcomes without a particular signature nose.</p><p>Everyone’s face is different and deserves individualized attention and planning to create a natural looking rhinoplasty result. If your surgeon has a particular focus in rhinoplasty, they will have a large representative sample of rhinoplasty photos to review. Now you won’t always find the exact nose that you desire in their gallery, but at least you can see that your surgeon is capable of creating noses that look very similar to what you desire.</p><p>Rhinoplasty Testimonials – take a look at the testimonials from other patients that had rhinoplasty by that surgeon. Speaking to some of the surgeon’s past rhinoplasty patients can also be very helpful to gain insight into their experience having rhinoplasty with that surgeon and their office staff. Computer Imaging – this is a very helpful exercise that offers a huge advantage to you and the surgeon. It is not a sales tool to convince you to have surgery.</p><p>It is truly an educational tool that allows you to see what direction and degree of change is likely with your nose. It also allows the rhinoplasty surgeon to determine if you have realistic expectations in terms of a surgical outcome. If there is any disconnect or miscommunication, this could result in a disappointing experience for both the patient and the surgeon. (John M. Hilinski, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Top rhinoplasty surgeon for You!</h3><p>The key element in choosing a Rhinoplasty Surgeon comes down to 4 things – Experience, Expertise, Outcomes and Compatibility</p><ol>
<li>Experience – Rhinoplasty is the most difficult cosmetic procedure we do in Cosmetic Plastic Surgery so it requires a Surgeon with tremendous judgment and experience to give you the best potential result you desire</li>
<li>Expertise – This operative requires specialized skill, training and focus to give you the results you want – even with the best expertise, there are no guarentees of a great result in any cosmetic procedure.</li>
<li>Outcomes – In your consultation with your Rhinoplasty Surgeon, you need to ask all the difficult questions about the Surgeon’s personal revision rate, use of general anesthesia and where they operate. It must be in an accredited surgery facility as this conveys an added level of patient safety .</li>
<li>Compatibility – Find a Surgeon that you not only like but trust long term.</li>
</ol><p>I dont operate on any patient unless I like them and have find them to be realistic about their potential results using educational computer images and showing them post op photos as well. Please look to see if your Surgeon is Board-Certified in Plastic Surgery or ENT . Being a member of a specialized Society like the Rhinoplasty Society also delineates that your surgeon specializes in Rhinoplasty (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing a rhinoplasty surgeon in USA</h3><p>It is important to make an educated decision when choosing your surgeon because the impact to your life is so important.</p><p>You don’t want a discount neurosurgeon or a discount parachute. Certainly board certification is a plastic surgery specialty is important.</p><p>Additionally, it is important that your surgeon has extensive experience in rhinoplasty. Of all of the procedures in cosmetic surgery, rhinoplasty requires the most skill, experience, artistic ability, and attention to detail. Not all surgeons have the same skill sets and experience.</p><p>Make sure you interview your surgeon critically for these skills and review the before and after galleries. Also make sure your surgeon has years of experience. If you go through this process, you will end up making the right choice. (Paul E. Chasan, MD, )</p><p>I’m a Plastic Surgeon who does a lot of Rhinoplasty surgery and I would have trouble finding the best nose surgeon in another community.</p><p>My best advice is to seek board certification first. If you have a large group plastic surgery practice in your community, that group usually will have their own “nose” specialist.</p><p>Interview several surgeons and demand to see before and after pictures of patients that your surgeon has operated on. (Stephan Finical, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to find the best rhinoplasty surgeon in USA?</h3><p>Like all plastic surgery, do basic research online about credentials: board certified in plastic surgery? Do not base your decision on online reviews. Then, go see the doctor and the office. If you have to pay for a consultation, it is worth it.</p><p>When you do go for a consultation, ask the surgeon, if he or she can help you and what would be done? Can you see photos of noses before and after? Can morphing be done, not to promise but to help you see if what you are imagining and what the plastic surgeon sees is the same.</p><p>Nose surgery is very complex, even though it is a small area. If youi are unsure, go back for a second consultation. Most people are unhappy with the results not because of how it was done, or who did it, but what was done. You want to feel that if the outcome is not right the surgeon who gained your trust will be there to see you through the process. (Jeffrey Ditesheim, MD, FACS, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no such thing as the best anything. There are only degrees of quality and reproducibility of results. There is an old adage that “Good judgment comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgment.”</p><p>Essentially, expertise in rhinoplasty comes from experience in managing both simple and difficult rhinoplasty cases. Selecting a surgeon is a challenging process. A good start is to select a board-certified plastic surgeon in USA, who is a member of ASAPS, which requires several years of practice in cosmetic surgery before conferring membership.However, certainly many board-certified otolaryngologists are highly qualified rhinoplasty surgeons as well. I would ask the surgeon how many rhinoplasties s/he has done, ask to see numerous photos in both profile and frontal views, and figure out whether you are comfortable with the communication style of a prospective surgeon.</p><p>Sometimes you have to see 2-3 surgeons and then spend 2-3 consult visits with the one you select before it will be clear that you have a good fit. Even with that, however, rhinoplasty (or any procedure, for that matter) comes with no guarantee of results. What you really want is to know that if there are issues of dissatisfaction or the prospect of a revision in the future, how will the surgeon deal with your concerns?</p><p>Does the surgeon take the time to listen to your goals in your consultation? Does the surgeon honestly discuss the risks and alternatives, or do you feel railroaded into surgery?Does the surgeon try to elicit realistic goals and set your expectations properly? While there are some surgeons who elect to specialize only in rhinoplasty, they do not represent the majority of plastic surgeons, and their worst results are often no better than the worst results of any other plastic surgeon.</p><p>And every surgeon has a set of “best” results that would compare favorably to any other surgeon’s “best” work. An experienced surgeon should be able to show you some pictures of “homerun” results but also some “average” results, to give you perspective on the possible outcomes.</p><p>Ultimately, a good surgeon strives for a “best” result every time s/he steps into the operating room. All that being said, a surgeon who has done 200-300 rhinoplasties will probably exude more confidence in his/her ability to render a good result reproducibly than say, someone who has only done 2-3.</p><p>Most USA surgeons are somewhere in the middle in rhinoplasty volume. Again, communication, credentials and realistic expectations are the keys. (Tim A. Sayed, MD, FACS, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
