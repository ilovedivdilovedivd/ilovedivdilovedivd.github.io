An examination is necessary to determine what is leading to the crookedness and decide what techniques are necessary to repair it.</p><p>Often structural cartilage grafts are used to reposition and strengthen the nose to ensure as durable and symmetric a result as possible.</p><p>I always counsel my patients that creating a perfectly straight nose from a deviated one is very challenging. Certainly, a significant improvement should be attainable. (Thomas A. Lamperti, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correcting a Crooked Nose with Rhinoplasty</h3><p>I advise my patients considering rhinoplasty that the most difficult part of the rhinoplasty procedure is making a crooked nose perfectly straight.</p><p>Oftentimes, the use of cartilage grafts or a Gore-tex implant are indicated. What I typically tell these patients is to expect an improvement of 70% in the crookedness. (Jeffrey Epstein, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked Nose Repair</h3><p>Repairing the crooked nose is one of the more difficult challenges in rhinoplasty. Various parts of the nose can be asymmetrical or deviated which can lead to a crooked nose deformity including deviation of the nasal septum, nasal bones, or asymmetry of the lower lateral cartilage.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2122" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Often times, crooked noses may have associated functional issues associated with them as well. There are many nuances which can help make the chances of success and improved symmetry more likely. Surgeons who correct the crooked nose deformity well should have expertise in both septoplasty, rhinoplasty, and advanced rhinoplasty techniques. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Repair of a crooked nose</h3><p>A crooked nose, not matter what is causing the crookedness, can almost always be fixed. Since there are many things that can make a nose look crooked, the plastic surgeon must be able to analyse the problem as well as know the techiques for the reconstruction and be skillful at using them. (Howard T. Bellin, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty can change the nasal tip</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2120" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b84afbc2471436b99cf348a882e6f6e0">

</div><p>The underlying cartilage may be the source of your nasal tip asymmetry. Surgery can be very effective in repositioning the tissues and restoring a balanced tip. If this is the only correction needed the procedure may be relatively short (Robert Mounsey, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correction of crooked nose</h3><p>There are many reasons to have a crooked nose and a deformity of the tip cartilages is one of those reasons. Typically there are several components to the crooked nose including : Mal-position of the tip cartilages deviation of the septum deformity of the bones. Generally , if the cartilage is severely misshapen I would recommend an open technique to correct the deformity and bring the nose back into balance. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2121" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-07ae121aa7dd4bff790c0c876e6cda10">

</div><p>Rhinoplasty experts will be able to confirm your diagnosis, make additional suggestions and offer solutions, whether these are surgical or non-surgical depends on the correct diagnosis. I typically perform an open rhinoplasty even it is only the tip cartilages that are misaligned as I can fully visualize all the pertinent anatomy and sculpt accordingly. (John Philip Connors III, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nasal Tip Reshaping Is Possible</h3><p>Reshaping a nasal tip is most certainly possible. Technically what needs to be done will depend on what you are experiencing.</p><p>Though the procedure can be done through an open or closed approach, I find it more effective to address tip problems through an open approach. (D.J. Verret, MD, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You may need open rhinoplasty as this is the best bet for fixing a crooked nasal tip. You may need cartilage grafting of the tip from the septum or ear in addition to the tip sutures for finer correction of the tip. However an exact plan can be given only after examining you. (Anup Dhir, MD, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are two main considerations when assessing a crooked nose. The apparent crookedness may be caused by asymmetry of the boney part of the nose, closer to the face, or by the cartilaginous portion of the nose (closer to the nasal tip).</p><p>Crookedness of either or both parts of the nose can certainly be corrected. The key to this is proper analysis of the cause of crookedness and proper planning.</p><p>This is particularly the case with a crooked nasal tip, since the cartilage has spring to it and a type of elastic ‘memory’.</p><p>The spring and elasticity of the tissue in this area, as well as the contributing forces of the adjacent structures, must all be taken into consideration in planning for correction of the crooked nasal tip. (Michael R. Macdonald, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Fixing Crooked Nasal Tip</h3><p>A crooked or asymmetrical tip can be fixed with rhinoplasty surgery. An experienced surgeon will know what techniques necessary to improve your appearance.</p><p>It is exremely unlikely the problem was caused by your sleeping position. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A crooked nose tip can be fixed with rhinoplasty</h3><p>Generally the best approach is an open rhinoplasty where the cartilage can be completely visualized and corrected. The cartilage can be trimmed and sutured and sometimes additional cartilage must be placed on the tip to give it more support.</p><p>Additional cartilage can be obtained from the septum or from the ear. If you go to a good rhinoplasty surgeon, they should be able to improve the crooked tip. (Usha Rajagopal, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correcting a crooked nose</h3><p>Correcting a crooked nose should be a part and parcel of rhinoplasty. An experienced nasal surgeon will determine exactly which anatomical parts of the nose are causing the crooked appearance, and there are a few.</p><p>Only then the surgeon can prepare a proper plan and perform an appropriate procedure. In some patients there is an internal deformity that could be unmasked during a rhinoplasty.</p><p>If not corrected properly during surgery this can result in a crooked nose after the rhinoplasty. Make sure you choose an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon to correct your nasal deformity. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It isn’t likely that your sleeping position has created a crooked nose. More likely, the nose cartilages have changed over time and have become crooked through a gradual bending or warping. An experienced rhinoplasty surgeon will be able to make a diagnosis for you after examining you, and let you know what is involved in fixing your crooked nose. Although at times complex, you should certainly be able to get improvement, regardless of how crooked your nose is to begin with. (Minas Constantinides, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Fixing the Crooked Nose</h3><p>Fixing a crooked nose is not easy, especially if the crookedness was not caused by an injury. A nose that is crooked through growth and development, often need surgery on the tip, the nasal septum, the base of the nose and possibly the bones. You should seek an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon, one who has performed numerous procedures of the nose. (Sheldon S. Kabaker, MD, Oakland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A crooked nose tip can be fixed</h3><p>Rhinoplasty is a popular and effective surgery to recontour the shape of your nose. There are multiple ways to adjust or fix to contour of a nasal tip. This is a delicate procedure that often involves small stitches or adding small piece of cartilage. For this reason, it is essential that you work with a board-certified plastic surgeon has a great deal of experience with rhinoplasty, cartilage tip suturing techniques, and cartilage grafts.</p><p>They will be able to examine you and compose a surgical plan that will help you meet your needs. In our practice, we find the use of digital photography and digital morphing software to be essential. We morph the photograph of every patient as this is an excellent education and communication tool that allows us to fully understand what the goals of the patient are and to show them what is realistically possible. Be sure that he find a surgeon that can offer this important tool to you as well. (Pat Pazmino, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Treatment of nasal tip</h3><p>The tip of the nose is cartilage and skin. Treatment of an unacceptable tip can be easily accomplished with a tip rhinoplasty.</p><p>An experienced surgeon can alter, add, or remove cartilage as needed to reconstruct your nose to the desired appearance. (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is probably not due to your sleeping position, but just the way it grew.</p><p>See an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon to fix this as well as anything else such as deviated septum, etc. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked nasal tip</h3><p>I do not think your sleep patterns have altered your nasal tip. Asymmetry is common in every ones body. The good news is it very often can be made more equal with surgery called Rhinoplasty. This out patient procedure requires the skin to be raised off the underlying structures, through small incisions. The architecture is then reduced or added to for a more equal result. Some small sutures then close the incisions. Hope this is encouraging. (Rodger Wade Pielet, MD (in memoriam), Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correcting a Crooked Nasal Tip</h3><p>In general, the answer to your question is yes. You noted that your nasal tip appears to have fallen down, or collapsed, on the one side. This could certainly contribute to having a crooked nasal tip. I would doubt, however, this is the result of sleeping on that side of your nose.</p><p>Nonetheless, an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon should be able to help improve the shape and contour of your nose. This may include use of cartilage grafting to rebuild the tip and provide more symmetry. Make sure you see plenty of other patient examples from your chosen plastic surgeon before proceeding. (John M. Hilinski, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nasal tip surgery is common</h3><p><a href="../rhinoplasty-tip/index.html" target="_blank">Nasal tip surgery</a> is common and usually successful. Talk to a rhinoplasty specialist and you will hear how this can be improved. You will likely need to have an open approach rhinoplasty, where a small barely noticeable incision in made under your nose. (Oakley Smith, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked nose tip can be fixed</h3><p>Nasal tip surgery or tip plasty can be performed to improve and straighten the nasal tip. Sometimes additional cartilage grafting needs to be performed, and osteotomies are performed if the nasal bones are crooked. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There are surgical options for correction of crooked tip.</h3><p>It depends on the cause but, yes, it can generally be fixed. This will likely require an open tip approach. This may also necessitate cartilage grafts from the septum. Seek consultation with a qualified surgeon to learn your options. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nasal asymmetry</h3><p>Some asymmetry in the nose is normal. If you have tip asymmetry and want it corrected, this can often be accomplished with a tip plasty. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
