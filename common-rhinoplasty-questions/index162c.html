First, discuss the external appearance of your nose, and how it will change.</p><p>One of the best tools to do that is to use computer imager, so that both you and your surgeon have an idea as to the desired aesthetic outcome. Another valuable tool is to look at a number of before and after photos. A reputable surgeon will have a wealth of patients’ photos to share with you, there might even be your type of a nose so that you can get a realistic idea of what is possible.</p><p>Another aspect of nose job is the function of the nose. A reputable surgeon will assess your airway, what if anything needs to be done about it, and the degree of improvement in this aspect.</p><p>Make sure you understand the recovery process, both short term and long term. In our practice an important part of surgical process is the pre-operative preparation of the patient. This includes special vitamins and homeopathic remedies. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>First you should start off by consulting a board certified plastic surgeon. Once you have an appointment scheduled, do some research on the surgeon.</p><p>Take a look at their before and after pictures, how many years they have been practicing and if they specialize in nose job. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2312" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Training and experience are big points. Look at lots of his before and after pictures. Rhinoplasty is a very complicated procedure. Make sure your surgeon specializes in this. Make sure your surgeon is Board Certified by The American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, The American Board of Cosmetic Surgery or The American Board of Plastic Surgery. (Gregory Pippin, MD, Metairie Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Select a plastic surgeon who specializes in nose job.</h3><p>There are many important considerations when selecting a nose job surgeon.</p><p>First seek either a board certified plastic surgeon or a facial plastic surgeon who is a member of The Rhinoplasty Society and The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2311" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-4a7b238664083e65d5be4ddbc0d7436e">

</div><p>Review their credentials and their websites. Examine their before and after photos. Check the state medical board to review their standing with the board. During your consultation, express your concerns both physically and functionally.</p><p>Determine if the surgeon has similar goals in mind. Determine whether you feel confident with this surgeon, their office staff etc. There are many surgeons to choose from. Find one that best suits you. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty questions</h3><p>When discussing your possible nasal surgery with a surgeon a frank discussion of several issues is required Training and board certification Personal philosophy about changing the nose and goals to be achieved number of rhinoplasties performed per year Types of rhinoplasties performed, i.e. African American, Asian, Caucasian, male, female etc.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2310" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Recovery and number of visits anticipated percentage of revisions required (Talmage J. Raine, MD, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Consultation</h3><p>Before scheduling a consultation, hopefully, you’ve narrowed down a few surgeons that have the experience and background in nose job. It is important to find a surgeon that specializes in facial plastic surgery and has plenty of experience with nose job surgery itself. During this part of the process, I believe you should identify how many nose job surgeries has the surgeon performed in the last year and if this is his/her specialty. At the time of the consultation, I believe it’s important that you identify the goals with the surgeon and view before/after images of patients with similar goals.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2313" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-786f37e2dcabe0adfd2b6382831f14c7">

</div><p>I find that computer-generated-imaging is a powerful communication tool during the consultation that allows the patient and I to view possible outcomes of surgery. Lastly, your rapport with your surgeon is a key element in the success of your surgery. Do you feel comfortable speaking with the surgeon? Do you feel that he is listening and clearly understanding your desired outcomes from surgery? I hope these answers provide some guidance in your endeavors. (David Mabrie, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Questions before nose job</h3><p>Rhinoplasty is a very challenging procedure to do well. You want to insure that your surgeon is well-trained and board certified in Plastic or Facial Plastic Surgery. Ask if they do nose job surgery frequently and very importantly. If they like doing it.</p><p>Don’t let price be a determining factor. It will cost you more in the end. Look at before and after pictures and make sure that you and your doctor are on the same page for the desired result. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Questions to ask during your rhinoplasty consultation</h3><p>First & foremost, it is important that you consult with a surgeon who is Board Certified.</p><p>This ensures that they meet a strict set of criteria which are very important when considering a rhinoplasty, as it takes quite a bit of skill and experience to perform one successfully.</p><p>The second question you need to ask is how many rhinoplasty surgeries have they done?</p><p>You want to make sure the surgeon you choose has a great deal of experiencing in performing a rhinoplasty, and does them on a fairly regular basis.</p><p>I’d also recommend asking to see before and after photos of previous patients to ensure that your aesthetic and the surgeon’s are a good match. Digital imaging can also be an extremely helpful tool in helping you and your surgeon set a realistic goal in terms of your final results.</p><p>Ultimately you need to feel 100% comfortable with your choice of surgeon. Be sure to give them a detailed medical history, including any issues such as snoring, trauma, allergies, use of nasal sprays, recreational drugs, etc.</p><p>Schedule a consult and allow them to perform a detailed internal and external exam of your nose and bring in any records of past trauma they can review.</p><p>This will help them to make an informed decision on just how they can help you achieve a desirable result. (Scott W. Mosser, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Questions to Ask Your Surgeon</h3><p>Rhinoplasty is the most difficult procedure in all of plastic surgery. The consultation should very much be a two way street. Patients are trying to find out if their surgeons are the right fit for them and meet minimum competence standards. While there are lists of standard questions which should be asked, here are a few questions which a competent surgeon will have no difficulty answering: Can you perform a septoplasty?</p><p>Rhinoplasty and septoplasty seem like two separate procedures. However, there The septum is such an integral part to rhinoplasty that not being able to perform one should disqualify a surgeon in my opinion. The septum is analagous to the foundation of a house. This would be similar to being a builder of sky scrapers but not being able to work with steel. It just is not likely that a good result is going to be possible. How many rhinoplasty procedures has the surgeon performed? A surgeon should perform at least 500 rhinoplastys at a minimum.</p><p>It is just a fact, that surgeon who performs a procedure with more regularity and over a longer period of time is much more likely to be more facile than a surgeon who performs it occasionally. This is especially the case with such a complex procedure such as a rhinoplasty.</p><p>Has the surgeon written an academic paper on rhinoplasty? Surgeons who are specialists at something and are good at it write about it in academic journals. An academic journal will select a work by having peers review it and accept it if it is worthy of publication. Even surgeons who are not academic types, will write about what they are good at.</p><p>Why is this important? At minimum, to be considered to be an expert in a field, the surgeon should have written at the very least an academic paper about that topic. Some academic papers are by special invitation by peers. Some academic papers are about an insight about rhinoplasty which that surgeon may have. Either way, an academic paper demonstrates minimum competence.</p><p>This does not mean having written an academic paper makes a surgeon a good rhinoplasty surgeon. It just states that a surgeon who has not, likely is not a rhinoplasty expert or qualified. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty requires a great deal of skill and knowledge</h3><p>In order to get the best result possible make sure your surgeon is board certified. Their are different specialties that perform rhinoplasty. Certification by the American Board of Facial Plastic Surgery or the American Board of Surgery lets you be sure your surgeon has some body to oversee and discipline the surgeon and maintain standards. A prospective patient should ask the surgeon to see before and after photos and if possible speak to any recent patients. The patient must be comfortable with the surgeon and intuitively feel they will work well together. (Robert Mounsey, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What shold I ask my potential doctor about nose surgery?</h3><p>You should ask your potential doctor what his training is. He or she should have trained in Facial Plastic surgery . Ear nose and throat surgery or Plastic surgery.</p><p>Ask them how many nose surgeries do they do per year. Is nose surgery one of their primary surgeries they do a year? What is their revision(re-do rate).</p><p>What sort of complications they have had with their patients. Ask to see before and after pictures and if they have patients that would be willing to talk to you about their surgery.</p><p>If any of these questions are met with discomfort consider seeing someone else (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Questions to ask your rhinoplasty surgeon</h3><p>The most important question to ask is how many rhinoplasty procedures has your surgeon performed and how often do they do rhinoplasty.</p><p>But you should also get an idea of your doctors philosophy on the nose and the techniques that they plan to use.</p><p>You should also make sure that your surgeon is a Board Certified Facial Plastic Surgeon or Board Certified Plastic Surgeon.</p><p>Remember that Board Certified cosmetic surgeon is not the same thing as the other 2 above. (Jason B. Diamond, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What to ask your nasal surgeon before surgery</h3><p>Deciding on an elective procedure such as rhinoplasty is a very important decision. You should have complete confidence in the surgeon with whom you are consulting and I encourage you to ask questions.</p><p>It has been said that while rhinoplasty is not that hard to perform, getting good results can be very difficult! There is not one secret question or key answer but several issues are vital:</p><ul>
<li>(a) what is the level of experience of your surgeon,</li>
<li>(b) how many procedures like this have they performed in the past,</li>
<li>(c) what will you likely experience not only in surgery but in the ensuing 12 months of healing,</li>
<li>(d) what are the likely risks and complications including the necessity of a second procedure, and</li>
<li>(e) can I speak with a prior patient who may have had a similar procedure.</li>
</ul><p>Board certification by an appropriate medical board is important because it demonstrates the surgeon has met certain criteria of education, training, and competency. The ABFPRS, ABOto and ABPS all are legitimate certifying boards. Also, listen to your intuition. Does the surgeon explain the procedure in simple clear terms? Does the surgeon make time to answer all of your questions versus seemingly in a big hurry? Do you feel comfortable with this surgeon? Do you feel pressured? Take your time in deciding. You may want to interview more than one surgeon prior to making a decision on this important surgery. (Donn R. Chatham, MD, Louisville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What should I ask my doctor about rhinoplasty?</h3><p>The first thing you should ask is whether or not your doctor is board certified and be specific. The American Board of Plastic Surgery and the American Board of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery are the two boards that are the official board certifying body,</p><p>The American Board of American Specialties. Next ask what percentage of his practice is rhinoplasty and how many does he do a year. Rhinoplasty is a very difficult operation and to do it well, it must be done frequently. Lastly, interview more than one doctor and choose the one with the credentials that you feel the most comfortable with. (Jack P. Gunter, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Speak with past patients of the surgeon</h3><p>One of the best ways to evaluate your surgeon is to talk to former patients who have gone through the rhinoplasty process. The experiences of such patients can give you a better idea of the quality of care you can expect from the surgeon. Therefore, you should ask to speak to a couple of the surgeon’s previous rhinoplasty patients. Any qualified facial plastic surgeon should be willing to put you in contact with former patients. In fact, most qualified surgeons maintain a list of former patients who are willing to talk about their experiences with people like you who are considering nose surgery.</p><p>In addition, you should read any patient testimonials on the surgeon’s web site.</p><p>Questions to Ask Former Patients:</p><ul>
<li>Why did you choose this surgeon?</li>
<li>Were your results close to what you were shown on the computer imaging?</li>
<li>Are you pleased with your results?</li>
<li>Was there anything about the rhinoplasty process you weren’t prepared for?</li>
<li>Is there anything you wish you’d done differently?</li>
<li>If you had complications, how did the surgeon handle them?</li>
<li>Were there any additional costs that hadn’t been discussed?</li>
<li>Would you go back to this surgeon for another procedure? (Paul S. Nassif, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
