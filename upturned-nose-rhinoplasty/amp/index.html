<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>You choose your surgeon carefully, now trust him to guide you through this difficult period. It is not uncommon for the nose to look turned up early on. Allow 2 to 3 months to pass, and I am sure it will look much better. (Rodney A. Green, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Never judge a nose by the way it looks in the first few weeks after surgery. Often, the nose goes through changes for 6 months to a year and a half after surgery. However, I am concerned that the tip usually moves in the opposite direction after surgery. It usually moves upward as the swelling subsides. In any case, be patient. (Robert M. Freund, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Many elements of your result will evolve over the next several weeks and months. Try not to read too much into these early appearances of your nose. Patience is your best medicine at this point. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Turned up tip after rhinoplasty</h3><p>It is rather common for the nasal tip to appear a bit turned even after the nasal bandage comes off. Most of the settling will occur in a few weeks.</p><p>Nasal tip control during rhinoplasty is paramount, but easily achieved. In cases with poor tip support one can see post-operative droop, in cases with too much tip cartilage removed in a wrong place the tip can permanently turn up.</p><p>Only a skilled and experienced nasal surgeon can achieve good tip control. I’m sure you picked a good surgeon, and your tip will settle nicely. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tip swelling is normal right after rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1912" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-8ab5a7c31cff085398f64f1b4ffe51d8">

</div><p>The nose begins to swell right after rhinoplasty and reaches a peak after about three to four days. Swelling occurs over the bridge of the nose as well, however the tip is the “mobile” part of the nose and can swell upward or appear to turn. The taping and splinting your doctor applied will guide and control the swelling and as the swelling goes down the splint begins to loosen and the tip drop, usually at about one week. Your nose should look pretty good at a week and continue to improve throughout the year. Many are a bit anxious and uncertain until the splint comes off. Elevation, ice, and a little time are all that are needed at this point. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose tip will come down</h3><p>Dont worry too much. This is rather common. By two weeks, it should come down quite a bit. Ask your surgeon if he or she thinks taping it down would be helpful. (Steven H. Dayan, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nasal tip upturned after nose job or rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1914" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>It is quite common that the nasal tip will be turned up after rhinoplasty or nose job. This is usually due to swelling and the tape. The tip should settle into place and come down to a natural position at about 3 weeks. (Etai Funk, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Early Post Operative Rhinoplasty Appearance</h3><p>It is not uncommon after a rhinoplasty to notice the nasal tip turned up slightly. This is normal especially early post operatively from swelling. One can experience swelling, bruising, and the tip may be turned up somewhat early post-op. I would not be too concerned about it unless it persists for more than 4-6 weeks. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nasal tip rotated after rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1913" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-02789b834a765e40428f56089194dadc">

</div><p>After rhinoplasty the tip will often lift up as a result of the swelling. This takes a few weeks to settle down. The exact time frame depends on the specific surgical techniques used. (Thomas A. Lamperti, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty changes following surgery.</h3><p>It is not uncommon to see changes secondary to edema (swelling) following rhinoplasty. Sometimes steroids may be useful during the acute postoperative period to reduce these changes. If the change you notice now still is of concern over the next 6 months, then it may be appropriate to review this with your surgeon.</p><p>However, it is likely to improve on its own without any necessary intervention. (Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD, Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tip up after rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1911" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b072d38a55f3f498b7dbeaee804cca72">

</div><p>You mentioned that your surgery was just 3 days ago and that’s WAY too early to evaluate the result. Often the tip is turned up right after the surgery from normal swelling. Try to relax, and contact your surgeon. (Darrick E. Antell, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose Tip Upturned After Rhinoplasty</h3><p>The upward rotation of the nasal tip is a desired outcome of rhinoplasty in many cases. In some cases it may be due to postoperative swelling. It is best to wait a few months for the nose to settle down.</p><p>Post rhinoplasty swelling can take as long as a year to get to the final result. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty tip</h3><p>It is expected that your nose will appear turned up or too short right after rhinoplasty. As time passes and the swelling goes down, the tip will drop back down to a more acceptable level. This happens in almost all cases, in fact, I make sure I let patients know this before surgery so they don’t freak out after. Don’t worry, it’ll be fine! (Ronald J. Edelson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Upturned nose can be improved with rhinoplasty</h3><p>As seen on the link below one can reduce the upturned appearance and excess width of the nose with rhinoplasty.</p><p>Based on your side photo you appear to be a good candidate for rhinoplasty. (Sam Naficy, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Risk of Uneveness after Correcting a Wide Nose and Upturned Tip</h3><p>Although rare, there is always a risk of uneveness after rhinoplasty surgery. The profile line can be maintained, even if it is necessary to narrow the upper 2/3rds of your nose.</p><p>The tip can be narrowed, tip projection decreased, or the tip de-rotated depending on the goals of you and your surgeon. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty for wide upturned nose</h3><p>There is always the risk of having asymmetries present after rhinoplasty surgery. All noses have some degree of pre-existing asymmetry.</p><p>The bridge can be built up with cartilage grafts in the supratip area of the nose, which would push the tip down.</p><p>Narrowing of the nasal bulb can be accomplished with osteotomies and bringing the nasal sidewall inwards.</p><p>In skilled hands the chance of asymmetry is very mild and the nostrils usually remain the same.</p><p>It is important that you go to a very skilled rhinoplasty surgeon who has performed thousands of rhinoplasty surgeries. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>An open rhinoplasty can bring your tip into balance with your nasal bridge</h3><p>It appears that your tip is somewhat over projecting while your bridge (dorsum) is relatively straight. Decreasing tip projection will give your nose a more balanced appearance. If the tip is wide, then a careful combination of removal of some cartilage and reshaping of the remaining cartilage will provide a more narrowed and refined tip.</p><p>If the bridge is not too wide, you may just need a tip plasty, but if the upper part of your nose is wide or needs to be reduced in projection, then you will need a full rhinoplasty with osteotomies (breaking of the bones of the upper nose).</p><p>Either way, an open rhinoplasty allows accurate adjustment of the nasal structures. If the nostrils are large, these can be reduced and still appear to be even. Similarly, an experienced plastic surgeon should be able to blend the nasal tip and nasal dorsum to achieve a smooth transition and avoid uneveness. (Michael D. Yates, MD, Huntsville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Deprojection is what you need</h3><p>Hi Barbie, From the profile view you showed, your tip looks overprojected (projecting too far from your face) and a little rounded. Your bridge height and contour on this view look good. It is possible to give you a straight profile by deprojecting your tip alone. There are ways to do this that will not create excessive nostril flare, and will stabilize and support your tip while giving you the desired amount of refinement.</p><p>Your other questions about nostril narrowing and thinning from the front require a front view in order to be able to give you any useful information. If your bridge is wide, you may need osteotomies to narrow the bones and middle part of your nose. If you see an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon, he or she should be able to help you achieve your goals. (Jason Litner, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty and tip</h3><p>Without seeing other views it would be difficult to tell you for sure. But, a tip can be done to decrease the overall height and projection and certainly soften it without doing anything significantly for the other structures. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correcting the Wide Nose with the over projecting tip.</h3><p>More than one view of the nose is needed to advise you on what MAY be applicable in your case. You would probably benefit from a Tip rhinoplasty (refining the tip and lowering it to reduce its projection). Lowering and de-rotating the tip will result is some rounding / flaring of the nostrils. You can simulate it by pushing the nose towards the face and watching the nostrils bow out. This flaring, if needed, can be corrected with a wedge (Weir) excision at the time of the nose surgery OR at a later date, if you wish as an office procedure.If the nose is too wide for you and it is estimated that you could breath through a narrower nose, it can be narrowed by in-fracturing it. Dr. P. Aldea (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Chicago rhinoplasty</h3><p>Since we only have a side view of you, I can’t really answer your question. I would advise you consider seeing Dr. Dean Toriumi in Chicago who is felt by most to be a top rhinoplasty expert. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
