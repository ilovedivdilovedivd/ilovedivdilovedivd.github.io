The youngest age that a nose job can be done is 15-17 in a female and 17-19 in a male because that’s when most of the nasal growth has completed. Doing a nose job at a younger age than that requires circumstances such as a congenital deformity, severe nasal airway obstruction or deviation which will require functional correction.</p><p>This needs to be individualized based upon the patient’s symptoms of nasal deformity. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Ideal Age for nose job: When Both Physically & Emotionally Mature.</h3><p>Nose job is a common procedure that teenagers contemplate. While there is not a specific age requirement, there are some general guidlines that surgeons consider with teenage patients. First, is the patient physically mature? Is the patient still growing? In females, the skeletal maturity can occur anywhere between 13-15 years old. In males, 14-16 years old.</p><p>Second, is the patient emotionally mature? nose job is a serious operation. The results can be dramatic. Teenage patients need to be emotionally prepared to undergo surgery and understand what surgery can an cannot accomplish. (C. Spencer Cochran, MD, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When nasal bones have fully developed</h3><p>There is no ideal age for getting a nose job done. However, 16 years of age is probably the minimum age so as to make sure that the nose bones have finished growing prior to embarking on an elective cosmetic procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1848" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b527d53b3c9f8347f60fc0f1d1176e70">

</div><p>Nose surgery can be done at any age as long as the patient is in good physical health. To get an idea what can be accomplished with the procedure, please see the link below (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>nose job when the nasal growth has stabilized</h3><p>The best age is when the nose has slowed it’s growth and has reached a stable appearance. You are the best person to judge that. It is when the nose has not changed for well over a year. This is typically about 14-16 for a female and 16-18 for a male. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Late teens is optimal age for nose job in females</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1849" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5c2b43db30d37388c501e254aa351542">

</div><p>Nose job, by definition, includes a surgical repair of the nasal bone and cartilaginous elements of the nose. However, the nasal bone and cartilage continue to develop until the late teens and possibly into the twenties. Optimal timing of a nose job should be in the late teens to avoid postoperative changes in the bony and cartilaginous nose that may change the shape of the nose after surgery. I choose to delay surgical repair of the nose until the age of 17 or 18. Being conservative is always beneficial. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Minimum Age for nose job</h3><p>The minimum age for males is 16 to 17 and female 15 to 16. If there is significant nasal deformity causing psycho-social stress these ages can be even lower. I also interview the patient and parents to determine if the are emotionally ready and have realistic expectations for this operation. (Daniel Reichner, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1850" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-776df262a4772db4178d1ca60b035920">

</div><h3>Wait until your facial growth is nearly complete before having nose job or plastic surgery</h3><p>I usually wait until you are 18 years old before doing a nose job or “nose job”. Most facial and nose growth occurs by menarche (when you started having your period) but your face bones will continue to grow and mature for 1 or 2 more years. The reason I wait is that if you have your nose job at 15, and your facial and nose bones continue to grow, then the problem that you wanted to fix, say a bump on the nose, may come back.</p><p>To avoid the possiblity of having to have a second operation, I prefer to wait until you are 18. Some children mature faster and have reached maturity by 16 or 17. If this occurs, the pediatrician can check bone growth on x rays to see if your bones have reached maturity. (Brooke R. Seckel, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Rhinoplasty or cosmetic nose surgery is one of the most common adolescent plastic surgery procedures; however, it’s important to only have nose surgery after you’ve reached at least 90% of your physical maturity as further growth and changes with your bone structure can alter your nose surgery results.</p><p>At 15 age limit, facial growth is complete in a majority of patients, so it’s an acceptable age to begin research for a more desirable nose. Also, it’s important for you to understand that surgery of any kind does have risks and can only accomplish a certain level of change.</p><p>It’s best to schedule a plastic surgery consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss all of these factors as he or she will best be able to determine if you’re a candidate. (C. Edwin Pittman, MD, Athens Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Once you have stopped growing, you may have a rhinoplasty. For a young lady, this is usually 16 years old. Your growth chart at your pediatrician’s office will show if you have leveled off in height. Also, xrays of the growth plates in your hands will show if you have stopped growing. (Stuart H. Bentkover, MD, Boston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Ideal age limit for Rhinoplasty</h3><p>I would recommend waiting until your nose has fully developed and is done growing. Typically, for females, at the ages of 15-17 and for males 16-18 is a good time to consider a rhinoplasty.</p><p>I would suggest making an appointment with a board-certified facial plastic surgeon to give you an in depth analysis of your specific nose. (Carlo Honrado, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There Is No Ideal age limit for Undergoing A Rhinoplasty; 15 Is Not Too Young</h3><p>There is no ideal age limit for having a rhinoplasty. With any type of cosmetic procedure, it should be done when the patient is ready for it. 15 is not too young for a young female to undergo a rhinoplasty. It is very important however, that the patient be mature enough to fully understand the procedure and the potential complications. It is also very important that there be sufficient maturity to comply with the postoperative care necessary.</p><p>If you are considering this type of surgery it is very important that you consult a fully trained, experienced and Board-certified plastic surgeon. Ask to see photographs of other patients who have undergone this procedure. Many surgeons provide computer imaging. This can be very helpful in a procedure such as a rhinoplasty. It allows the patient to communicate with the physician regarding their goals. It also allows the surgeon to fully understand the goals of the patient and make sure that the expectations are reasonable. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>15 is not too young for female rhinoplasty</h3><p>Different surgeons have different opinions on the minimal age for rhinoplasty. In my practice, the minimum age limit for girls is 15 and for boys is 16. This is not a hard and fast rule, but is based on knowledge that the facial skeleton does not undergo significant changes after this age, usually. (Richard A. Zoumalan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Earliest age limit for Rhinoplasty</h3><p>You want to make sure you have stopped growing first. If you have surgery while you are still growing, it can affect the growth of the rest of your face. If you have not grown taller or bought a larger shoe size in more than a year or for girls, a year after you start menstruating, you are probably finished growing.</p><p>Also, you want to make sure that your parents and family are supportive and able to help with post-operative care. (Angela Sturm, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is best to have a rhinoplasty when you are done growing. For a women, this could be as young as fifteen or sixteen.</p><p>If a young woman has not changed her shoe size in two years she is probably full grown. Estrogen stops bone growth (girls who develop early are usually short; late bloomers tend to be the taller women.)</p><p>Young men can grow to age twenty one or twenty two. More importantly, their jaws continue to grow which can make their noses appear smaller.</p><p>The most convenient time to have a rhinoplasty is a life transition. Between high school and college or college and career.</p><p>These are natural reset times when you will be making new friends and people are less likely to notice a change in your appearance. (Stephan Finical, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty age ideally</h3><p>In female they should have already started their menstrual cycle and finished their growth spurt.</p><p>14-to 15 years of age ideally. Boys are not candidates for rhinoplasty until 18-21 years of age because growth spurt occurs later. (Thomas Romo, III, MD, FACS, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What is the minimum age for Rhinoplasty?</h3><p>The minimum age for a rhinopalsty on a boy is 14 and on a girl is 13. Although if the rhinoplasty is being done for correction of a congenital deformity it can be done in an earlier age. (Bahman Guyuron, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Ideal age for teen rhinoplasty</h3><p>Rhinoplasty should not be performed until the nose has reached its adult size. This is typically achieved at age 15 or 16 years old for females and 16 to 17 years old for males. However, age is not the only factor that should be considered when determining if a teenager is ready for rhinoplasty.</p><p>I like to sit down and have a meaningful conversation with all of my teenage rhinoplasty patients, so that I can understand their reasons for wanting surgery, as well as their goals for the procedure. I need to assess their reasons and goals to make sure that the patient is emotionally ready for a surgical procedure and that the teen wants surgery for the right reasons. (Babak Azizzadeh, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There is no ideal age for rhinoplasty, but 15 is the minimum</h3><p>When undergoing rhinoplasty it is important that the nasal bones have fully grown. This usually happens at age 15 1/2 for girls and 16 1/2 for boys. Also, even though the parents will be signing the consent, I evaluate to see if the teenager is mature enough to understand the risks of the procedure. So in summary, while there is no ideal age for rhinoplasty – I have performed rhinoplasty on patients in their 60s – the patient should have finished growing and be mature enough to understand the procedure. (Andrew Miller, MD, Edison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The best age for a Rhinoplasty would be after age 15.</h3><p>The best age for a Rhinoplasty would be after age 15. That is when the bone structure and soft tissue start to mature. For boys it usually is a year later. The patient must also be psychologically mature and have parental support. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best age to get rhinoplasty</h3><p>The youngest female I will perform a rhinoplasty on is 14 years old and 16 years of age for males. In the end, these are not hard numbers but there is evidence that midfacial growth is not effected by a rhinoplasty, or more importantly, by a septoplasty where the midface growth signals take their cues from.</p><p>The patient must be mature enough to understand the consequences of a rhinoplasty and have to be able to participate in postoperative care of his or her nose on a daily basis. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Earliest Age For A Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Every patient matures at a different age. The goal is for the structures of the face to be mature so that the nose has finished growing, prior to manipulation. In a girl, 15 years old is around the earliest that a rhinoplasty is performed.</p><p>In males, 16 years old for select males. I usually make sure the shoe size has not changed for more than a year to see if the body is mature enough. Once the shoe size has stablized, physical maturity of the nose is often realized. The other factor which is important is the mental maturity of the patient. Undergoing an elective change to the body is a major decision. It requires maturity of the patient and support of the parents. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When there is no further nasal growth and the patient is emotionally ready.</h3><p>Rhinoplasty involves reshaping the nasal bones and cartilages to create a balance in the sub-units of the nose and proper relationships to the individual mid-face. Usually nasal growth is complete by late teens.</p><p>However this surgery is a process that requires patience and sometimes an adjustment to the way we have always seen ourselves.</p><p>For this reason it is important that a patient be emotionally as well as physically mature. Now is a good time to discuss your goals with an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon. (Stanley G. Poulos, MD, Greenbrae Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Normally, a girl can have nasal surgery at 13-14 years of age. In boys we will sometimes wait til they are 17-18 if they are still growing.</p><p>In other words, the nose will stop growing then with rare exception. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There are different ages for males and females, but 15 is uaually fine.</h3><p>For males, we usually wait until they are over 18 as they mature and grow later than girls. For females, if you have had your menses for a few years, are a reletively stable height and weight, then over 14 is reasonable. Another factor that needs to be evaluated is maturity, this is a surgical procedure and involves some risk. You need to be able to verbalize your desires and fears and understand the procedure.</p><p>It is important for you to look at your nose and tell your surgeon what you do not like and what you want. So, in other words, pure age is not the most important – maturity counts. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What is the Ideal Age for a Rhinoplasty</h3><p>The ideal age for a female is 13-14 and for a male is 15-16. First I would make sure that the skeletal growth is complete. This procedure may be done for a variety of reasons including medical and ethnic. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Minimum Age For Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Rhinoplasty should be performed electively after a patient’s nasal bones have stopped growing. Bone growth can be looked at with X-rays to determine their maturity.</p><p>Usually if the patient has gone through puberty, and the shoe and clothes sizes have stabilized, then it is safe to proceed with rhinoplasty. The minimal age is usually 15 to 16 years old. If a patient has thick and oily skin at this age, I prefer to wait a few more years as the skin improves. Your profile looks pretty good, so be patient. (Michael A. Persky, MD, Encino Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>15 is perfect age for rhinoplasty</h3><p>Your face has matured and you are excited about moving ahead. Rhinoplasty is safe and results predictable at 15. You are at a formative period of your life and nasal shaping can be very uplifting and help you move ahead with a positive self image and confident outlook. If you are confident with your surgeon go for it! (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The correct time for a cosmetic rhinoplasty depends or physical and emotional considerations.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Physical considerations</strong> – you should be fully grown – for a girl, the rule of thumb is one year after your first period.</li>
<li>
<strong>Emotional considerations</strong> – you must understand that</li>
</ul><ol>
<li>This procedure will not change your life or your friends.</li>
<li>It will not help you get a boyfriend.</li>
<li>People who like you for a new nose may not be the most loyal of friends.</li>
<li>Surgery takes times and can be disfiguring and painful, are you ready for these issues?</li>
</ol><p>If you think that you satisfy all of these considerations – then you are ready! (Robert M. Freund, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
