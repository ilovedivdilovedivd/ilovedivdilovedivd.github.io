<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>There are several ways to find the best rhinoplasty surgeon in the world without asking friends and family (although they are often a great source of information). Your family physician or internist often knows the surgeon in your area who regularly performs rhinoplasty and performs it well. Other sources can be hair stylist and aestheticians – they take pride in knowing who to go to and often stay up on surgeons in the area. While the internet should be approached cautiously, there are several great sites with good information and ratings on surgeons (like RealSelf!)</p><p>It is important to go to the surgeon’s web site as that can tell you a lot-what is there focus? Are they a facial plastic surgeon who does rhinoplasty regularly or a body surgeon whose focus is on breat augmentation and body work, but does rhinoplasty on the side?</p><p>Do they have lots of different before and afters of different types of cases? Also, check out you state board to see if they have a history of lawsuits. Lastly you should meet with several surgeons. Ask them if rhinoplasty is a major part of their practice. Ask to see before and afters. All of this will help you find an experienced surgeon in whom you have confidence. (Mark Hamilton, MD, Indianapolis Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Finding the <strong><em>best rhinoplasty surgeon in the world</em></strong> can be difficult, especially depending upon your geographic location. It is important to review the credentials of your surgeon, as a baseline measurement to ensure they have gone through the appropriate training to ensure they should even be performing the operation. In addition, there are many excellent surgeons with appropriate credentials who simply don’t do a lot of a rhinoplasty (for example some people choose to specialize in breast or body work, etc). It is best to find someone who devotes a significant part of their practice towards rhinoplasty surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_627" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In addition to all of this, it is of course important to establish a good relationship with a surgeon and feel that he or she understands your goals and is able to express and demonstrate a plan to try and achieve those goals. (Bryan Correa, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the best rhinoplasty surgeon in the world</h3><p>This is in the eye of the beholder. Certainly you want someone who has done many surgeries with good results, but quality always supersedes quantity. Also you want to find someone who will spend the time listening to your individual needs and really understands what you are looking for. (Joseph Shvidler, MD, Tacoma Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding the best rhinoplasty nosejob surgeon in the country</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_625" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>The only way to really find the best rhinoplasty surgeon in the world is to go through many many websites and compare the work of different surgeons using their before and after photos. Unfortunately a famous surgeon doesn’t mean a great surgeon although in most cases the most well known surgeons have good work. you must understand though that rhinoplasty is considered one of the most difficult surgeries to perform properly and predictably, so you must be sure to pick a rhinoplasty specialist. (Ben Talei, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to choose a plastic surgeon</h3><p>Choose a surgeon who is board-certified, with respected credentials, good results, and significant experience. During your first consultation, make sure you have a rapport with the surgeon. Get a sense for your surgeon’s ability to understand your goals of surgery and convey a plan to you. Make sure you can speak honestly and comfortably with your surgeon, and vice versa. Review before and after photos, and feel free to bring in photos of your own. If you are hesitant, get a second opinion. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty surgeon that is right for you.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_626" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You should start with choosing a board-certified plastic surgeon and make sure that they have extensive experience in this procedure. Then meet with them and makes sure that you feel comfortable that they understand your goals and make you feel confident that they can deliver. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Boris Cosmetic for number one nose jobs!</h3><p>I have been performing rhinoplasty procedures for over 40 years. Here at Boris Cosmetic, you will get the best results. Are you in or around the Los Angeles area? (George T. Boris, MD, FRCS, FACS, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What is the best way to find a good, qualified Cosmetic or Plastic Surgeon?</h3><p>Obviously this is a question that is posted multiple times as it can be a life changing decision. When i council my patients on this, I try to be as honest as possible. I’ve recently wrote an editorial discussing this. Perhaps it may be of assistance. (James Bonaparte, MD, MSc, FRCSC, Ontario Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Several Tools for Finding Surgeons</h3><p>It is very hard to determine who the best plastic surgeon for rhinoplasty. I would start by looking for board-certified plastic surgeons who are on staff at respected hospitals, have good patient reviews, and have before-and-after pictures that reflect your aesthetic sense. Asking friends and physicians can be very useful, as well, to give you a starting point. If several people recommend the same surgeon, that is a very good sign. (Thomas A. Mustoe, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>The best plastic surgeon for rhinoplasty is the one who performs this procedure frequently with passion, has vast experience, perhaps even teaches the topic to the others, produces predictable results, does not accept just any outcome as the final result, demonstrates perfectionism, pays attention to the details, is honest about the results and even if you do not complain would point out the minor residual flaws that even you may not see them and suggest fixing them if you agree. (Bahman Guyuron, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Qualified rhinoplasty surgeon</h3><p>In theory rhinoplasty can be thought of as purely cosmetic (addressing aesthetic concerns only), purely functional (addressing breathing concerns only) or a combination of both.</p><p>The reality is that the two cannot be entirely separated – changing the appearance of the nose can result in impaired breathing and functional surgery to improve the nasal airway can have a negative impact on appearance.</p><p>So it’s very important to find a surgeon that is highly competent at both to ensure that your aesthetic goals are met and that your nasal airway function is maintained or substantially improved if necessary.When seeking rhinoplasty information some important points for consideration include:</p><ol>
<li>Is the surgeon board certified or double board certified? Surgeons that are double board certified more often have extensive experience that includes cosmetic rhinoplasty, surgical management of the nasal airway and revision rhinoplasty.</li>
<li>Who do doctors in the community send the more difficult rhinoplasty cases to? (J. David Holcomb, MD, Sarasota Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Advice to Find the Best Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>Rhinoplasty is a complex and difficult operation to master. It has also evolved through the years to focus not only on form, but function. In the past, many people who were operated on by skilled surgeons came away with nice looking noses that were difficult to breathe through.</p><p>Modern rhinoplasty aims to improve the aesthetics of the nose without sacrificing the patient’s ability to comfortably breathe. It is also geared towards lasting results. The factors you should look for to help identify someone who possesses these abilities are as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Board Certification</strong> – Chose someone who has board certification in Facial Plastic Surgery or Plastic SurgeryTraining – Where did they train? Big programs often have a wider breadth of experience.</li>
<li>
<strong>Photos</strong> – Look at both general examples of their before and after photos, but also try to see if you can find an example of a nose that had a similar appearance to yours.</li>
<li>
<strong>Computer Simulations</strong> – This can be an educational experience for both you and the surgeon. You can learn what the surgeon has in mind (just remember that anything is possible on a computer simulation, but not everything is achievable in the OR) and the surgeon learns what your desires. This will ensure that the two of you are on the same page.</li>
<li>
<strong>Personality</strong> – This is a team effort. You should feel very comfortable with the surgeon and his staff. You are building a relationship and will likely see him/her many times in the year after the procedure, so you want to feel very confident in your choice. Don’t have an elective operation with a surgeon who you do not have a good connection with. (Sirius K. Yoo, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul><p>Find a surgeon who listens to your desire and how you want your nose to look. Extensive experience and knowledge count the most, (Vartan Mardirossian, MD, Jupiter Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Rhinoplasty is an extraordinary surgery. Essentially a rhinoplasty is really a long surgery made up of individual surgical maneuvers, each with it’s own goal for execution and outcome. Your surgeon plans your outcome by combining a series of mini-procedures appropriate for your goals.</p><p>It is important for the surgeon to anticipate how changes in one area affect others both during your surgery and also during healing. Remember that a rhinoplasty will heal for at least a year, and more realistically a few years after your procedure is completed.</p><p>The best surgeons for any procedure will combine training, experience, artistry, and attention to detail with communication and personality that makes the experience exceptional for the patient.</p><p>Ask about the surgeon’s experience, speak with past patients, and seek a few consultations before making a choosing the right surgeon for you. (Todd Christopher Hobgood, MD, Phoenix Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the best rhinoplasty surgeon</h3><p>The best doctor for a procedure, in general, is the doctor who does this surgery commonly. A first step in screening would be to ensure that you find a doctor who is board certified to do rhinoplasty.</p><p>Both plastic surgeons (through the ASPS) and facial plastic surgeons (through the AAFPRS and ABOto) are board certified to perform rhinoplasty.</p><p>The next step would be to look to see if they perform rhinoplasty frequently. If the plastic surgeon’s practice emphasis is, for example, liposuction, then you probably do not want them doing your surgery. Have an open and honest conversation with them.</p><p>Any doctor worth his or her salt will be up front about their experience and share that with you. (P. Daniel Ward, MD, Salt Lake City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding the right doctor for Rhinoplasty takes some work…</h3><p>Rhinoplasty is complex surgery so it is important to take steps to find the right surgeon. The most important criteria is the experience of the surgeon, and this is broken down into two parts. First, it is best if the surgeon has several years of experience.</p><p>Their specific training is not as important as how long they have been performing rhinoplasty, because little details are learned on every case that is done. These details add up over time to being able to provide excellent, consistent results.</p><p>Second, your surgeon should be performing rhinoplasty on a regular basis. Some plastic surgeons have a lot of experience, but only perform a few rhinoplasties every year. It is best to find a surgeon who performs rhinoplasty every week. Once you are in for a consultation, look through the albums, and you should be able to see MANY rhinoplasty photos, not just a handful. This will ensure that he or she performs rhinoplasty regularly.</p><p>Ask the surgeon which hospital he or she is on staff with. This is something that you can check, and the hospitals do extensive background checks on their doctors so you don’t have to. Finally, determine if you are getting a good feeling about the surgeon; whether he or she really listens to you, and you feel like the surgeon is someone you can trust. If your gut is telling you something else you should listen to it. (Andrew Miller, MD, Edison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to Find the Best Plastic Surgeon for nose job</h3><p>The best way to find a plastic surgeon that you will trust is to talk to others who have had the procedure and see if they trusted him or her. If you want to keep the procedure a secret, searching the internet for surgeons who have been named a Top Doctor in their field by Castle Connolly or U.S. News is a good starting place as these surgeon are selected by other doctors.</p><p>In the case of rhinoplasty surgeons, searching under ‘Otolaryngology’ or ‘Ear, Nose, and Throat’ surgeons and see if any of them are a facial plastic surgeon would be a great start. Just because they don’t make the list doesn’t mean other surgeons aren’t qualified. In the end, interviewing 2 or 3 surgeons and seeing which plastic surgeon you really feel comfortable with is the most important. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing Your Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>The best place to probably start is with your primary care doctor. Your doctor probably knows the names of some reputable rhinoplasty surgeons in your area. Once you have these names, it is important to do your own research. Your research should include a visit with the doctor. You should ask your surgeon how many rhinoplasty procedures he or she performs every year and ask to see photographs of the results. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
