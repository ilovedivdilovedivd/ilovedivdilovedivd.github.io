Imaging can be very helpful in ascertaining you are both on the same page. (Paul C. Zwiebel, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Rhinoplasty is one of the most demanding surgeries from a surgical standpoint. It takes very careful evaluation, detailed preoperative planning, and exacting execution.</p><p>Most of my rhinoplasty consults take over 2 hours in total consultation time. From a patient perspective, the procedure is normally done under general anesthesia.</p><p>I do 99% of rhinoplasties under general anesthesia. Do NOT let someone convince you that sedation is safer.</p><p>They are both just as safe, it is dependent on the practitioner. The procedure takes 2-3 hours on average depending on the complexity of the case, scar tissue, etc.</p><p>Patients stay 45 minutes to an hour in the recovery room before being discharged home. My patients do have a custom-molded splint on their nose which stays on for 1 week.</p><p>Patients are able to return to daily life activities within 48 hours and over 95% of my patients do not require pain meds after 2 days.</p><p>Patients tell me that the procedure is not painful, merely uncomfortable. They tell me that it feels like having sinusitis in that their head feels heavy, but it does not hurt unless you touch your nose.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1716" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5f3bc633f45debb510b784afb432e11c">

</div><p>The splint comes off in 5-7 days. At that point, you do look like you have had nasal surgery. At about the 8 day point after surgery, you can go out and no one should know that you have had surgery. However, fine details will take weeks to months to develop. Hope it helps! (Raghu Athre, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty results</h3><p>Rhinoplasty is considered one of the most difficult surgeries in plastics. It is also one of the most frequently revised procedures. With this in mind, it is wise to visit a number of surgeons and to seek out the one which is most likely to meet your expectations. Ideally, a rhinoplasty should be undetectable by others and should correct the deformity that exists from your previous trauma. Most surgeons will place an external splint and sometimes an internal splint. Results will be apparent when the splint is removed (generally 1 week). But the final appearnace will take 6 months to 1 year to reveal itself. (Jason R. Hess, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose rhinoplasty what you can expect.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1715" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2240a3b88f35be89b5b951ceaf8d3b67">

</div><p>Your experience with nose surgery , like all other cosmetic surgeries, is directly dependent on who you pick to be your surgeon. LOOK FOR A FACIAL PLASTIC OR PLASTIC SURGEON WHO PREDOMINANTLY DOES NASAL SURGERIES. Ask to see pictures and if available get an photo imaging of what you can expect. Surgery of the nose is usually minimally painful and very satisfying for the majority of patients who have it done. (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty increases self-esteem.</h3><p>Rhinoplasty can be a very positive treatment. From an aesthetic standpoint, it should result in a natural appearance. No one should be able to tell whether a person has had a rhinoplasty. Rhinoplasty can vary in length from 45 minutes to several hours depending upon the nature of the surgery. It is typically performed under twilight anesthesia.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1717" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-e24e597143b25244ff1b1a78a26ec2eb">

</div><p><a href="../../rhinoplasty-recovery/index.html" target="_blank">Rhinoplasty recovery</a> generally occurs within 5 days at which time the nasal tape/splint is removed. However, there is a period of time ranging from 6 – 18 months where edema (<a href="../../nose-job-swelling/index.html" target="_blank">swelling</a>) can occur. This is of special concern when the tip of the nose is being modified with a rhinoplasty. If you have a broken nose that is obviously not straight an twisted, the benefit of rhinoplasty should be immediate. As the splint is removed, the nose should appear straight regardless of the swelling that is present. (Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD, Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Video Journeys</h3><p>Rhinoplasty can be a very rewarding experience. In the first 1 week- 2 weeks after surgery you will see the most dramatic changes in your appearance. The initial swelling will most dramatically reduce in this time period.</p><p>Any bruising, if you have any, should be gone by the end of this time period. The next 6 weeks you will see the majority of the final changes. Finally, minute/finesse changes in the nose are seen up to a year after the procedure. Obviously there are differences between people, and you should ask your experienced surgeon what you can expect. The link below will take you to a few video journey of patients who have had rhinoplasty surgery. (Jacob D. Steiger, MD, Boca Raton Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job Expectations</h3><p>Undergoing Rhinoplasty surgery is a pretty major decision. The nose is a key feature of your face and the surgery to modify it involves between 2 and 5 hours of surgery with healing and recovery up to a year.</p><p>So you should really take your time choosing a surgeon. Find someone that does a lot of rhinoplasties, ask a lot of questions, and ask to see a lot of before and afters. Many offices offer computer imaging to help discuss goals and possible outcomes.</p><p>Another option is sometimes your surgeon can inject saline under the skin of your nose to demonstrate some of the possible changes. Also very important is to have realistic expectations regarding recovery time and the possible need for a small secondary surgery.</p><p>Nationwide, approximately 25% of patients undergoing nose job can benefit from a second procedure. For more info on nose job, please click the link below. (David Mabrie, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Nose job usually is performed under general anesthesia. Depending on the extend of operative correction there is <a href="../../post-rhinoplasty-swelling/index.html" target="_blank">swelling</a> and bruising involved that may last for 7-10 days. There will some residual swelling that is minimal but can last about 6 months.</p><p>The recovery is not that painful but is uncomfortable as one’s nose feels swollen and tender with difficulty breathing. The results could easily be worth the pain. (Amir Moradi, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose surgery for broken nose</h3><p>The surgery to return the nose back to normal after an accident is not very traumatic. Most patients do quite well and are very satisfied with the results. Make sure you select a surgeon that has experience doing these types of surgeries. (Andres Bustillo, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Results of a nose job</h3><p>Your two questions are essentially: How should it look? Reshaping the nose with a nose job takes meticulous detail to the technical aspects of surgery with an artistic eye. The look should be individualized to each patient and should not be a “cookie cutter” nose.</p><p>To help with this, I offer preoperative imaging, both in 2D or 3D. This allows you and I to see what the results would look like on you. It ensures that your goals for an attractive nose are the same as mine.</p><p>I take those pictures, once we’ve decided on the final look, into the operating room with me and try to match it as closely as possible. What is the <a href="../../recovery-rhinoplasty/index.html" target="_blank">recovery</a>? I generally recommend one week that you are pretty much off after a nose job. It’s not a terribly painful operation, but you tend to feel kind of miserable, mainly because you can’t breath well. I don’t pack the nose, but the swelling, scabbing and crusting after surgery just makes it hard to breath. (John Bitner, MD, Salt Lake City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job can offer excellent results.</h3><p>Patients suffering from post-traumatic nasal deformities can expect excellent results and significant improvement in their appearance. Typically the correction will include repositioning of the nasal bones and often will require straightening of the nasal septum as well.</p><p>In addition, other features that you want to change can be addressed at the same time. This is usually a more difficult procedure than a typical reduction Nose job so choose your surgeon carefully.</p><p>Make sure he/she can handle the septal repair comfortably if it is needed. Otherwise the recovery should be uneventful. Give yourself several weeks to ‘lie low’ and just relax. Don’t expect to return to strenuous exercise or aerobic activities for about 3 to 4 weeks.</p><p>Pain should be minimal and breathing should be acceptable before the end of the first week. Again, the key is to find an experienced surgeon. (Jon F. Harrell, DO, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nasal surgery experience</h3><p>Nose job is unique for every patient. The analogy most often used is erecting a tent. The skin is the tarp and the bone and cartilage are the tent poles. Rearrange the tent poles and you have a different tent. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
