It allows you and your surgeon to be on the same page with respect to expectations and possible outcomes.</p><p>You should show the photos you like to your surgeon to see if that might be something attainable with surgery. (Eric M. Joseph, MD, West Orange Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Would You Be Offended if a Patient Brought a Different Doctor’s Digital Picture to You?</h3><p>The short answer is NO, I wouldn’t be offended, this happens all the time. Patients bring photos of noses they like, and images from other offices as well.</p><p>Communication between surgeon and patient must result in agreement prior to your procedure, and graphics assist in this effort, wherever they are from.</p><p>My patients are asleep during rhinoplasty, and I cannot ask them during the operation what they want. I need to know exactly what they want beforehand so I know what to do during the operation.</p><p>Your surgeon likely wants to know what you want (and don’t want) so he can be sure he agrees, and can accomplish your desired outcome. (Steve Laverson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Perfectly appropriate to bring another doctor’s photos to rhinoplasty consultation.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2529" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5729eadb6841f812a47a108d82e9cd34">

</div><p>The more your surgeon knows about exactly how you want to look, the better the chance that he will give you the look you want. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The more information to help communicate your goals the better!</h3><p>Absolutely not! It’s possible you misinterpreted the surgeon’s response. Having computer images can be helpful in articulating goals.</p><p>Of course they shouldn’t be used as a promise of what the actual results will be. (David Mabrie, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Photographs for Rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2530" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It would not be offensive to use another surgeon’s communication tool during your rhinoplasty consultation. Anything that can best help the patient describe their goals and expectations for the surgery is beneficial, no matter from where it came. (Norman M. Rowe, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Using Photographs to Communicate Goals?</h3><p>Thank you for the thoughtful question. No, I would not be offended by any photographs that a patient uses to help him/her communicate his/her thoughts or goals. Remember, that as plastic surgeons one of our major goals is to understand what patients are trying to achieve, whether they have realistic expectations or not, and whether or not we are able to meet their goals.</p><p>Photographs in my practice are a very valuable tool used for improving the communication process, given that word such as “natural” may mean different things to different people. Obviously you are very concerned about other people’s feelings, but in this case I don’t think you have to worry about your plastic surgeon’s feelings. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Digital photos and rhinoplasty</h3><p>I think it is ok to show your surgeon digital photos of what you want. It may or may nor be possible to achieve the same results as the photos, but it is a starting point. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>But remember, imaging is on the computer, it may not be possible to give you in real life what you can do on a computer. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Reviewing another Surgeon’s Digital Picture</h3><p>This would not bother me at all. In fact this has happened several times when patients came to me for consultation. Remember, imaging is a lot easier than the surgery. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Another doctor’s digital imaging only helps increase communication.</h3><p>I have this happen occasionally, and I never mind – in fact, I’m honored to be considered as another choice in the patient’s list of potential surgeons, and one that is considered kind and confident enough NOT to be offended by any patient who seeks another opinion elsewhere. If I am later on the list of potential surgeons being consulted with, then that means the patient is both thorough and thoughtful about the surgical process, cares enough to do her research and due diligence, and has not yet decided on her final choice of surgeon. I don’t care if she has seen ANY number of surgeons prior to coming to see me (or even if she wants to check out another few AFTER seeing me), I just want to be the one who is ultimately chosen as best equipped to fulfill her requests.</p><p>Computer video imaging represents a simulation anyway, and should never be considered a guarantee or promise of a specific surgical result. Ultimately, you should choose the surgeon who seems to have the most surgical skill and experience with your aesthetic procedure, and whose photographic results you like.</p><p>But unless ANY surgeon knows exactly what you want, there is only a random chance that a specific outcome you desire may be achieved; communication is essential, and good surgeons utilize any and all tools available to them to enhance the likelihood of successfully meeting any specific patient’s goals.</p><p>Anything that helps communicate your goals to your surgeon is considered a “plus,” and if there is any demonstration that this is not the case with any surgeon, I would cross them off your list. (Richard H. Tholen, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Would You Be Offended if a Patient Brought a Different Doctor’s Digital Picture to You?</h3><p>Not at all. Most patients will seek more than one consultation and I’m never offended hearing about another plastic surgeon’s suggested plan or looking at video imaging results. If you cannot articulate what you want but have a morphed image that demonstrates the look you want, absolutely you should share that photo. I am sure you like the other doctor because they are caring and have a good personality. If that is the case, they will welcome the additional information and it will help the two of you communicate better. (Stephen Weber, MD, FACS, Denver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty computer</h3><p>I dont think it would be out of line. In fact it might be a good test of the character of the surgeon. if he responds well – he his likely someone you can work with. i should say from you comments however that i think you are putting too much emphasis on computer generated images. these are tools that help discussion but they are not perfect predictors of results. (Adam Bryce Weinfeld, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is definitely a good idea to bring the photos from the first physician to the second as being on the same page with your surgeon is an absolute requirement if you are going to be satisfied. Just one word of caution, liking an image on a computer screen and getting the same result in real life is next to impossible. Imaging at best serves as an educational tool and at worst as a marketing gimmick. (Eric Sadeh, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty computer Imaging and Photos</h3><p>I would not be offended. I have used imaging since 1984 it is a great way to communicate what you desire and learn what the physician can accomplish. This was discussed this past week in the Rhinoplasty Meeting in NYC. Bring photos of what you like, an honest and capable surgeon will guide you through the process of developing a reasonable expectation.</p><p>Remember, you have only one chance of getting it right the first time. (Richard W. Maloney, MD, Naples Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
