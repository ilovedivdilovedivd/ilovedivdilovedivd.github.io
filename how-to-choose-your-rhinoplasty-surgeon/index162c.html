They should be certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Board of Facial plastic surgery.</p><p>Research their office. Is their surgery center accredited? Do they have abundant experience in Rhinoplasty & revision rhinoplasty. Ask for references. Ask to see before and after pics.</p><p>Make sure you mesh with your surgeon. Do they take time to answer your questions? Do they take time to completely evaluate your nose? Take your time, ask questions, and do your research.</p><p>Many of my patients schedule 3-4 consultations to discuss all of their concerns before they decide to have their surgery. Rhinoplasty is complicated and patients sense this. They need thoroughness and attention to detail. Look for those characteristics! (Raghu Athre, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Website, before-and-after photos and make sure this is a focus of the practice. This is a turf-battle area between facial plastic surgeons and full-body plastic surgeons.</p><p>Historically, some of the giants in the field of rhinoplasty have come from both facial plastic and full-body plastic surgery fields. The current trend is that the full-body plastic surgeons are getting less and less training in rhinoplasty and the facial plastic surgeons (usually trained in ENT and then do a fellowship in facial plastics) and becoming the leaders in the field.</p><p>There are certainly some full-body guys that are great with the nose and some facial guys that should be doing something else. Rhinoplasty is very difficult to master. Dr. Bite, a plastic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic once said, “instead of getting paid, you should pay the first 50 rhinoplasties you do.”</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_664" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Just as an example during my residency I did or assisted on &gt;75 rhinoplasties, during fellowship, 74, and now after my first year of practiced I just did my 50th. There are others who have done many more, but rhinoplasty must be a focus of the practice in order to achieve those numbers and experience. (John Bitner, MD, Salt Lake City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I agree with many of the points made by other surgeons. Ultimately choose someone who performs lots of rhinoplasty procedures. 100 a year may be a good baseline. Choose someone who you feel comfortable with and who you feel is on the same wavelength as you regarding surgical goals.

(Raja Srour, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Who is the best rhinoplasty surgeon?</h3><p>You should research the following about your surgeon</p><ol>
<li>Credentials: Is he a Board Certified Facial & Plastic surgeon (is he aslo an E.N.T.)? How long has he been in practice? First and foremost you need someone who is well trained.</li>
<li>Before & After Pictures: Does their previous work look good? There are no guarantees, but the past is a great predictor of the future. If consider whether he has significant experience with your particular ethnicity.</li>

<li>View simulated results: Computer technology allows the surgeon to virtually adjust your nose. Pay attention to how your surgeon describes what can be done, and how true to life the actual results can be.</li>
<li>Reputation: There are always people who have a bad experience, but the majority tend to get it right.</li>
<li>Talents: Is your surgeon an artist? Having an artistically inclined surgeon ensures they not only manage the technical aspect, but that they will give you best looking nose possible. (Ramtin Kassir, MD, Wayne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>

</div><ol>
<li>The surgeon should be board certified in either Facial plastic Surgery or Plastic Surgery.</li>
<li>Nose surgery should be one of the most common operations the surgeon does. (Don’t be shy, ask them!)</li>
<li>Your surgeon should have years of experience and should have done many nose surgeries. (Should be doing at least 50 plus yearly)</li>
<li>If you see a laundry list of all the surgical procedures that your surgeon does and nose surgery is one of 20 plus procedures, be suspect and ask your surgeon how many he does a year.</li>
<li>Does your surgeon perform intra-nasal surgery? if he cannot do it and he needs to get an ENT doctor to assist him its better you find one surgeon for your surgery. There are too many well trained surgeons for you to have to have two surgeons for your procedure.</li>
<li>See what his or her waitng room is like, do are the patients happy and are they content with their result? It helps you make up you mind.</li>
<li>If you are not completely comfortable with your surgeon before your surgery it is unlikely you will learn to love him after wards. You should always be completely happy with your surgeon going into your surgery.</li>
<li>Ask about the surgeon’s revision rate and how they handle the financial situation if you need more surgery. And finally, look at before and after pictures to determine if you like his aesthetics and the type of nose surgeries he or she is doing. Good luck (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><p>Finding the <strong>best revision rhinoplasty surgeon</strong> can be difficult. Most plastic surgeons feel that rhinoplasty is the most difficult cosmetic surgery performed.</p><p>The nose is a very tricky place to operate. Your surgeon should ideally perform a good number of rhinoplasty surgeries each year, typicaly 75-100 or more depending on geography.</p><p>Ask your surgeon about their referral patterns (how patients come to them.) It is important to now their mix of rhinoplasty cases (primary vs. revision) to see how difficult of a case load they carry.</p><p>Membership in key societies such as the Rhinoplasty Society, the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, the American Association of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, etc. shows dedication to the art and science of rhinoplasty.</p><p>Finally, board-certification with the American Board of Plastic Surgery and/or the American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery are a must.</p><p>Finally, make sure you get to see before and after photographs of other patients to see if your surgeon’s aesthetic eye appeals to you. If you do not feel comfortable with your surgeon, move on and continue your research. (Manish H. Shah, MD, FACS, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best Revision Rhinoplasty Doc</h3><p>Experience,expertise, outcomes, and compatability. Dr Rohrich hits the nail on the head, as he usually does. Most all board certified plastic surgeons are trained to do rhinoplasties. Some plastic surgeons really like to do them and spend a lot of their practice time doing noses.</p><p>Some do just noses. Does that mean they are the best. Maybe not. Just because they like it doesn’t mean they hear what the patient needs and do the procedure the patient wants, It may be ego gratifying to the doctor to create a beautiful nose but if it not the nose the patient needs then it is not a beautiful nose.</p><p>Photos of the doctors before and afters work can help, friends who have had the procedure done might be of help. Some physicians might refer a patient to a doctor outside their own geographic area. It is a big decision to have surgery of any kind . take your time and see several consults.</p><p>Check to see they have been trained to do rhinoplasties. Check to see they are doing them currently. A big assist in this matter is to seek Board Certified Plastic Surgeons. Vist a few and if you feel the physician understands your needs and is qualified to do the procedure then he or she is ‘the best’ revision rhinoplasty doctor for you. (Jon Sattler, MD, Glendora Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Of course, this is a very subjective topic. The best revision rhinoplasty surgeon is one who sees eye-to-eye with you regarding the creation of the look you want for your nose/face and who has the experience , energy, and tools to accomplish these aesthetic goals with high reliability and predictability while at the same time preserving the function (breathing) of your nose.</p><p>The best revision rhinoplasty surgeon would also be able to fix any possible unplanned sequalae after a rhinoplasty (i.e. be able to revise you), although the chance of a revision may be small. The best way to find out if your surgeon has a proven track record for excellent primary and revision rhinoplasty is to visit several doctors, review their intended plan, view their before and after photos for patients with your similar features, and speak with references. Having rhinoplasty is a big decision, and you must be prepared for the time commitment and the (small) possibility of a revision.</p><p>Rhinoplasty is a tremendous passion of mine and I would encourage you to make an appointment for an in-person consultation for a comprehensive evaluation. (Thomas T. Le, MD, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are some excellent rhinoplasty surgeons in our communities. Check out the galleries on the websites of those in your community. Rhinoplasty takes an artistic eye and an ability to perform it. Not all Board Certified plastic surgeons should be doing noses. Unfortunately I have corrected a few in my twenty years in practice, mainly for aesthetic reasons and occasionally for healing issues. Once you start doing your research there will be some names that will keep showing up.</p><p>Go and see them and see what they have to say about doing a rhinoplasty for you. (Kimberly A. Henry, MD, Greenbrae Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Rhinoplasty is considered one of the most complex procedures performed by plastic surgeons. It requires a unique understanding of functional nasal anatomy, as well as an in depth knowledge of aesthetics.</p><p>Experience is extremely important – a good Rhinoplasty surgeon has been performing the procedure for at least seven to ten years. The surgeon should be certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery or the Amercian Board of Otolaryngology Facial Plastic Surgery or both.</p><p>Your doctor should be able to show you before and after photographs, and understand your surgical goals. It is important that you are able to work with your surgeon as not all cosmetic procedures are “perfect” the first time around, and if a “revision” is required you need to be able to work together to achieve a great result. (Rondi Kathleen Walker, MD, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Who is the best rhinoplasty surgeon USA?</h3><p>First, there is no best. There are lots of excellent rhinoplasty surgeons. Those would be the surgeons who are board certified, but also one who has done a “ton” of rhinoplasties. I was lucky to have done 105 rhinoplasties my residency training program.</p><p>However, I have learned much more since I was in private practice, which began almost 4 decades ago. A plastic surgeon can never be satisfied with results if they want to improve through time with experience. Education is an endless frontier with all plastic surgery procedures, especially rhinoplasty surgery.</p><p>Skill and experience are the most important factors in rhinoplasty surgery, and artistic ability is not far behind.</p><p>Rhinoplasty surgery is considered to be one of the most difficult procedures to learn to do well because there are so many interrelated cartilages and bones. What a surgeon does to one affects the others.</p><p>A plastic surgeon must have a written plan related to the length and width of the bony part, the projection and width of the tip, the size of the hump, the length of the upper lip, the skin quality, and much more. The septum will affect the exterior appearance as well as the ability to breath properly.</p><p>Cartilage grafts may be necessary for certain depressions and tip projection. These all must be preplanned. The surgeon must have a wide array of small techniques for each of the various problems and proposed treatments necessary for each nose. They are all different. The plastic surgeon must also communicate his plan thoroughly with the patient.</p><p>They may have completely different opinions of what looks proper for their face. Finally, it is a good idea to see and discuss pre and post operative photos with your plastic surgeon. (E. Ronald Finger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Finding the “best” rhinoplasty surgeon USA is not as difficult as many patients may think. The first correct step would have to be that you make sure that the surgeon you are considering be BOARD CERTIFIED and of ample experience especially with facial surgeries.</p><p>Based on my extensive experience and a triple board certification, it is important that you take a look at before/after photos and read the reviews of former patients. Visiting the surgeon’s website is a good source of information when it comes to check his/her credentials. Finally, scheduling a consultation will allow you to compare the results of your personal research with the surgeon you will be conversing with.</p><p>This step is major as it will give you the chance to either develop the trust with the surgeon or not. During your consultation, please make sure that you do ask all the questions you may have regardless of whether you think they are important or not. Sometimes, the least important questions will be the missing link to help you perceive the big picture. (Ali Sajjadian, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Seeking the Right Rhintoplasty Surgeon USA</h3><p>Choosing the best rhinoplasty surgeon USA is a combination of several factors including the surgeon’s experience, expertise, training, and understanding of your objectives. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The Best Rhinoplasty Surgeon USA</h3><p>“Experience keeps a dear school.” Some rhinoplasty surgeons are better than others. Expertise does come with age in this operation. Rhinoplasty is probably one of the most challenging cosmetic surgical procedures. The various stages or technical aspects of this surgery, once learned, is no different from any other technically challenging surgery.</p><p>Most plastic surgeons have been trained to perform microsurgery – operating under a microscope to sew miniscule blood vessels and nerves. There is no microsurgery in rhinoplasty. What is challenging is that this surgery unlike any other is that the sum of each individual action of the operation can affect other aspects of the operation.</p><p>It eventually becomes evident that there is an ART to fine rhinoplasty. It is the melding of the technical to achieve the ideal aesthetic for that patient. Each patient then defines his/her own ideal aesthetic. Therefore rhinoplasty is not a “cookie cutter” operation. How far to take the bump down directly afftects how much of the tip to refine, how much tip refining determines how much tip rotation to achieve. It goes on and on.</p><p>It is likened to dominos lined up; knock down the first domino and the rest tumble. One action affects alot! An “accomplished” rhinoplasty surgeon is one that has performed LOTS of rhinoplasty. Various techniques will allow for certain characteristic changes. Whether a surgeon performs open or closed rhinoplasty should not be a reason to choose one surgeon or another. What is important is to review the surgical results. Credentials are important – they ensure that the physician has had appropriate training and exposure to the operation.</p><p>As with any surgery, should you have any questions about the care rendered, results obtained and happiness of the patient, dont be shy and not ask the surgeon to speak with some of his/her patients. (Jonathan Berman, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the Right Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>The choice of a surgeon for such an intimate and important procedure should be taken with care. There are a lot of important factors, but perhaps the most important is your relationship and understanding with the surgeon.</p><p>Howe well do you communicate? Do you share an idea and a goal for how you want your nose to look (and function)? You should discuss the approach that will be used, the expected recovery, and the follow up process BEFORE the procedure. Finally, a review of any available pictures will be helpful. (Evan Ransom, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to Find the Best Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>First, make sure the plastic surgeon is board certified. Look for a plastic surgeon who has an additional one year cosmetic fellowship with facial surgery. This would mean that the plastic surgeon has at least 4 years of cosmetic rhinoplasty training, far more training than most surgeons out there.</p><p>Next look for credentials – where did the doctor get his degrees. For instance, graduating from elite schools makes a difference. Finally, look at before and after photos and find a surgeon who performs hundreds of rhinoplasties a year. (Kenneth B. Hughes, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Develop a Game Plan with your Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>When choosing a surgeon for your nose job, skill and experience are extremely important. Make sure that you see plenty of before and after photos.</p><p>So that you know if you like your surgeon’s “aesthetic eye.” Then make an operative plan with your surgeon, to make sure that you are both “on the same page” in terms of your specific desires. (Kevin Brenner, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing your rhinoplasty surgeon</h3><p>Selecting the proper surgeon for your nose is an important choice, as rhinoplasty is a procedure who’s final result is more surgeon dependent than most.</p><p>There are a couple of suggestions to find the surgeon that can help produce the result that you desire:</p><ul>
<li>Look at photos of previous rhinoplasties that the surgeon has performed. Do they look natural? Do all of the noses look the same or are the noses individualized to fit the individual faces?</li>
<li>Ask about the experience of the surgeon. How many rhinoplasties does he/she perform?</li>
<li>Perhaps most important, what is your comfort level with the surgeon? Do you feel that you are both on the same wavelength in terms of what you hope to accomplish? Does it seem like his/her vision matches that of your own? Answering these questions should help you find a plastic surgeon that can create a nose that you love.

</ul><h3>Finding the “best” rhinoplasty surgeon</h3><p>If you are near a major metropolitan area, there are usually a few experienced rhinoplasty surgeons who are likely to be able to perform your operation with nice results. I encourage you to find surgeons who perform a high volume of both primary rhinoplasty and revision rhinoplasty. Many plastic surgeons in the community do few nasal surgeries a year (&lt;10) and consider themselves experts. However, like anything in life, the more you do, the better you become at doing the surgery. One thing that can tip you off regarding whether a surgeon has low nasal case volume is if on their listed procedures, rhinoplasty is buried down towards the bottom or even absent from the list. </p><p>Meet with several rhinoplasty surgeons with good reputations in your area and maybe beyond your locale. The nominal costs of the consultation(s) pale in comparison to the costs of having a bad result. You should feel comfortable with that surgeon’s level of expertise and their ability to explain the procedure to you in a way that makes sense. Rhinoplasty is the hardest of all plastic surgery procedures so it pays to do your research. (Michael M. Kim, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
