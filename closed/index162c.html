In this technique, incisions are made in the nose to perform the changes.</p><p>Open rhinoplasty involves internal incisions and a tiny incision at the base of the nose in the columella. Close rhinoplasty is an excellent technique for minor changes to the nose.</p><p>Open rhinoplasty is often advocated for for complicated rhinoplasties. Discuss the differences with your surgeon to see what is best for you. (Gregory Pippin, MD, Metairie Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed rhinoplasty candidates</h3><p>The closed rhinoplasty is when the nose is refined through incisions that are hidden inside the nose. This is an excellent way to take down, raise or narrow a bridge.</p><p>When work needs to be done on the tip, we usually perform an open rhinoplasty to be more precise with our results. (Jason B. Diamond, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>No external incision in closed rhinoplasty</h3><p>A closed rhinoplasty is one where the incisions are all made inside the nostril. It is a good technique when minimal correction is needed.</p><p>Simple crooked noses, isolated dorsal humps are examples where this approach can produce good results. Consult your surgeon to see if this may be a good option for you. (Corey S. Maas, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Endonasal rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2441" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a86fe13a97262f852bdd92c8b935f613">

</div><p>“Closed” rhinoplasty is a term that has fallen out of favor. It is more properly called endonasal rhinoplasty. This means that, with the exception of perhaps small incisions to narrow the nostrils or inser a chisel into the bones, all the work on your nose is done through the inside of your nose. Incisions are made to expose the cartilages inside the nose, and sometimes the cartilages are “delivered” from inside the nose to see them better.</p><p>In an open rhinoplasty, a small, usually minimally visible, incision is made between your nostrils that extends inside the nose. This enables the surgeon to see your entire nasal architecture. The choice of approach depends on the surgeon’s perference, whether or not your nose is crooked, skin type and many other factors. It is not about the incision. (Stuart H. Bentkover, MD, Boston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed rhinoplasty has in hidden scars but not always ideal approach</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2440" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>A Closed Rhinoplasty refers to a technique for refining the nasal tip from within the nostrils. Therefore, in the Closed approach all the incisions made to shape the tip cartilages result in scarring that is hidden inside the nose.</p><p>The open approach requires an incision on the surface of the Columella, the structure that divides the nostrils. Working through this incision the surgeon is able to peel the skin off the underlying tip cartilages before making the changes to these cartilages.</p><p>The incision on the Columella results in a potentially visible scar. However, most surgeons would agree that the open technique affords them improved visibility for tip cartilage refinement over the closed approach.</p><p>In addition, I have found the scar resultant from the open approach to be virtually invisible and well worth the improved tip cartilage exposure. If your Rhinoplasty requires only minimal tip work then a closed approach may be feasible.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2439" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>However, if you require intricate tip cartilage refinement and possible tip grafting an open approach would be best. A consultation with a surgeon will be necessary to determine which of the two techniques is best for you. (David A. Ross, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open vs closed rhinoplasty</h3><p>In a closed rhinoplasty there are only incisions inside the nose and all work is done up the nostrils. In an open rhinoplasty the incisions inside the nostrils are connected across the skin of the columella so that the skin can be pealed back and the structures of the nose can be addressed under direct vision. Each has its role, but I personally do almost all of mine open. Since most agree that all revisions should be done open, why not do the first one open and try to avoid needing any revisions? The scar doesn’t show, the recovery is easy and the visualization is so much better than closed. Its like working in another room either through the key hole or with the door wide open. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Closed rhinoplasty is rhinoplasty which does not have an external incision on the nose. In patients with the appropriate anatomy, closed rhinoplasty can offer quicker healing times and excellent aesthetic results.</p><p>Not all closed rhinoplasty(s) are the same, and there are a large amount of technique and surgeon dependent issues with closed rhinoplasty.</p><p>It is considered a lost art form amongst rhinoplasty and so be certain a surgeon has appropriate knowledge with closed rhinoplasty. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed rhinoplasty</h3><p>The closed rhinoplasty involves performing the surgery entirely through incisions inside the nostril. Open rhinoplasty involved an additional external incision across the columella, the strip of skin between the nostrils.</p><p>Each surgeon has his or her own preference. I like the closed rhinoplasty but not all surgeons are experienced or trained in this technique.</p><p>The most important factor is not whether rhinoplasty is performed open or closed, but rather the skill and experience of the surgeon you choose. (Ronald J. Edelson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What is ‘Closed’ Rhinoplasty</h3><p>This can be confusing for potential patients since all Rhinoplasty procedures are in fact ‘open’ – in that they involve incisions made in the nose to allow visualization and modification of the nasal structures.</p><p>However typically a ‘closed’ approach refers to surgery wherein the incisions are entirely inside the nose, hidden from view.</p><p>An ‘open’ Rhinoplasty, on the other hand adds a small horizontal incision across the narrow band of skin separating the nostrils on the outside skin of the nose.</p><p>There is some debate among surgeons as to which approach is best. Both have pros and cons and each surgeon usually has his/her reasons for using one or the other approach. In my practice I use the closed approach for most uncomplicated procedures, using the open approach for many revisional cases, complicated tipwork and twisted noses. Although the incision typically heals to be inconspicuous I would prefer not to create it unless the improvement in the final result would justify its addition. (Jon F. Harrell, DO, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open vs. closed rhinoplasty</h3><p>A closed rhinoplasty is when the surgeon uses hidden incisions inside the nostrils to correct the surgery, as opposed to external incisions in an open rhinoplasty. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed vs open rhinoplasty</h3><p>A closed rhinoplasty uses incisions hidden inside the nose and are made through the nostrils. An open rhinoplasty does the same except for making a small incision on the outside along the columella. This usually heals extremely well. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The term closed rhinoplasty is a misnomer</h3><p>Endonasal rhinoplasty involves using incisions ‘hidden’ on the inside of the nose; however, if the flaring nostrils need to be addressed, external incisions are made. There are some surgeons who only perform endonasal rhinoplasties and others who only perform open rhinoplasties.</p><p>For the right patient, one can use either technique to achieve an excellent result. In general, you should not worry too much about what approach is used, rather you should feel extremely comfortable that the surgeon you have selected will achieve the result you desire. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open versus closed rhinoplasty</h3><p>Rhinoplasty is a popular and effective surgery to recontour the shape of your nose. An open rhinoplasty is performed when the skin of your nose is lifted off of the internal cartilage and bone framework.</p><p>This provides the surgeon with excellent visualization of your structures and can help them create a consistent and beautiful result. A close rhinoplasty does not involve lifting the skin off of the internal framework. Because of the better visualization with an open rhinoplasty technique, many surgeons consider this to be a safer procedure that will more consistently provided results we want, especially in complicated rhinoplasties (Pat Pazmino, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
