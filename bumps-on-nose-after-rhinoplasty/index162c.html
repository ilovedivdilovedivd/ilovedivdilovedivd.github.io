<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Bumps after Successful Rhinoplasty</h3><p>The bumps you feel are likely related to the osteotomies (surgical fracture of the nose bones). It is common to feel a little bump or slight edge in the early post-op period.</p><p>This generally resolves over time. In some cases, massage to the area may help. However, make sure to review this with your surgeon before starting massage. (Evan Ransom, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>the irregularities may be in the region of the osteotomies which were probably performed during your rhinoplasty.Â Overall I agree with your surgeon in that things are very early and you can expect further changes. Some patients may feel ridges along the osteotomy sites. (Edward S. Kwak, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>It takes some time to assess the results of rhinoplasty</h3><p>As the nose heals it takes some time to allow the tissues to settle and see the final result. it is still early in the healing process.</p><p>Express your concerns with the surgeon who performed the procedure. A nose may appear crooked as the swelling resolves in an uneven fashion, but improve with time. (Robert Mounsey, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Hard bumps 6 weeks after Rhinoplasty are likely swelling</h3><p>It is almost impossible for you to tell if hard bumps are bone or cartilage after rhinoplasty. They often are the result of swelling and scarring around bone and cartilage will resolve.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3416" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-15f703de3983f123ee61ce5c9b664247">

</div><p>I know it is scary but it is likely to go away, but you will not know for at least three more months. I often start my patients messaging their noses at 6 weeks to help this resolve. Ask your doctor before you do anything tough. (Andrew Jacono, MD, Great Neck Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mild asymmetries are common.</h3><p>As you are very early in the recovery period, your surgeon is right to say âLetâs wait and see.â Hard bumps can be caused by many things. The most common problem is swelling. With time and gently massage, this will go away.</p><p>Less commonly, asymmetric bone breaks (osteotomies) used to narrow the nose can leave a small piece of bone jutting out known as a rocker deformity. If your surgeon used a perforation method to fracture the nasal bones, it can come out less than smoothly.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3414" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>Small bone shavings or cartilage trimmings that were inadvertantly left in place can solidify and cause problems. You will need to let the soft-tissue healing process work itself out.</p><p>If the hard bumps remain, then you will need a minor revision to improve them. Just work closely with your surgeon and be open to his/her doubts until the final product is known. (Manish H. Shah, MD, FACS, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bumps after rhinoplasty</h3><p>The bumps near your eyes are very likely swelling from the osteotomies. These may be asymmetric and can feel quite hard initially making it difficult to differentiate from bone. Unfortunately, its too early to make any determination and certainly too early to do anything about it even if it were something like a âRocker deformityâ.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3415" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Keep in communication with your surgeon as a hands on exam from an experienced rhinoplasty specialist is going to be the best way to evaluate the recovery and expected results. (Sirius K. Yoo, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Wait and see. If there is a slight irregularity in the bone along were it was cut (the osteotomies) this can often be filled a bit. If there is a piece of a graft sticking up, this can also be filed. Injections of steroids are commonly used for soft tissue swelling and scar. I too would wait 12-18 month before doing anything.</p><p>It is the nature of the operation that the nose does not always heal the way we want it to heal. (Stuart H. Bentkover, MD, Boston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Removing bump on bridge is often part of Rhinoplasty</h3><p>The size of the nasal bump on bridge doesnât make it;s removal any more or less complicated.Â The removal, in my case, is performed by using a surgical osteotome to cut through the bone on the top and then along each side of the nasal bone where it meets the face.</p><p>Itâs fairly routine for a Rhinoplasty, IMHO. (Francis R. Palmer, III, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bump on bridge Removal</h3><p>Your photo shows a moderate dorsal bump. Removal of the bump on bridge would be a routine part of a rhinoplasty for someone like you who wishes to have a change in their nasal appearance.</p><p>This does not present any particular difficulties. A good plastic surgeon ought to be able to achieve a good result for you. (Jeffrey E. Kyllo, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bump reduction is the #1 request in rhinoplasty</h3><p>Of all the things people come in to have improved on their noses, the number one request is to have their bump on bridge removed.Â Rhinoplasty cannot be considered either simple or complex. Each patient needs to be addressed as an individual and surgery tailored to their personal requests, needs, evaluation and ethnicity.</p><p>As a revision rhinoplasty specialist, sometimes its the patient who was deemed âsimpleâ and a cookbook technique was applied who had the biggest problems.</p><p>I find computer imaging very helpful to review mutual goals with patients. You should seek out a rhinoplasty specialist to discuss your specific needs and desires and let them discuss what is best for you. (Steven J. Pearlman, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty for bump and profile refinement, and reducing bulbous tip.</h3><p>Rhinoplasty for bump and profile refinement, and reducing bulbous tip is normal for a nose like yours. Refining the bulge at the base of your nose can be done. The most important part of having a good result is choosing a very experienced rhinoplasty surgeon who does natural noses. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Hump reduction is a common concern in rhinoplasty</h3><p>The single most common cause for rhinoplasty is reduction of a large hump on the bridge of the nose. This common feature does not make your rhinoplasty complicated. If you have done your research you know that rhinoplasty is generally a one to two hour procedure with a general anesthesia, and about one week of <a href="../recovery-for-rhinoplasty/index.html" target="_blank">recovery</a>, again not complicated. If you have carefully explored your goals and what you like, you are ready for consultation with an experienced surgeon. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bump on bridge reduction is a frequent request for rhinoplasty surgery</h3><p>Bump reduction is a particularly common request for female patients who are interested in a softer profile and would like the bump not to be so distracting.</p><p>Continue your research and find a surgeon that specializes in rhinoplasty. Here are some things to consider:</p><ul>
<li>How low do your want your profile?</li>
<li>Do you want the nose straight or with a slight âski slopeâ? If your surgeon has computer imaging this can help with planning. Another option is to print your picture and draw on the profile, outlining possible outcomes.</li>
<li>Does your tip move when you smile or talk? This can affect the severity of the bump. If you are interested in more information, please visit our website where we discuss bump reduction in detail. (David Mabrie, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul><h3>Getting rid of a bump on bridge during rhinoplasty</h3><p>Removing a bump is one of the most common reasons for getting a rhinoplasty. When theÂ bump is large, the nose will need to be narrowed.</p><p>In some cases, there is a risk of compromising the internal size of the airway during this maneuver, leading to breathing difficulty. Currently, spreader grafts are the accepted methods of preserving the nasal airway duringÂ bump removal rhinoplasty. Ask you surgeon about the technique he/she plans to use in you case. Discuss the option of using a spreader graft. (Maurice M. Khosh, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
