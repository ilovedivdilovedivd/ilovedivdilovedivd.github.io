<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Reducing the dorsal hump</h3><p>Usually reducing a dorsal hump is performed through a combination of rasping (using a file) or shaving down the bone and cartilage.</p><p>This is very commonly done. I would recommend you see an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon in consultation. He/she will be able to examine your individual anatomy and help give you a good idea as to what your final result will be. (Catherine Huang-Begovic, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Simplicity depends on the skill of the surgeon</h3><p>Asking “how simple” hump reduction is may not be the best question and may be misleading. In very experienced and skilled hands, hump reduction is probably the most “straigh forward” of all parts of a rhinoplasty however, the way you heal over the next few years will create changes in a favorable or unfavorable direction.</p><p>But I have seen plenty of patients with horrific nose jobs who come in for revision who had fairly “simple” goals and their surgery should have been fairly “simple” but their surgeon ended up doing things to their nose that made it so much worse, now requiring a very complex revision surgery. Find someone good and the surgery should be “fairly simple.” (Shervin Naderi, MD, FACS, Washington DC Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dorsal hump reduction surgery</h3><p>Reducing the dorsal hump is one of the most common requests from patients seeking a rhinoplasty. It is possible to isolate this area during the surgery, however it is important to make sure that your nose, as a whole, will still have a balanced and symmetrical appearance.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2376" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Creating an appropriate aesthetic relies on how the forehead transitions into the bridge of the nose and how the bridge of the nose transitions onto the tip.</p><p>For this reason, consulting with an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon in person will give you an even better idea if you are a candidate for just a dorsal hump reduction, or if other areas of your nose need to be addressed during surgery. (Babak Azizzadeh, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dorsal hump reduction</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2374" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Reducing a dorsal hump can be done through traditional rhinoplasty techniques, both open or closed rhinoplasty. Simple reduction can be performed through closed rhinoplasty procedure. Once the hump is removed osteotomies will be performed to narrow the nasal pyramid so as not to create an open roof deformity. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dorsal Hump Reduction with Rhinoplasty</h3><p>It is common to reduce a dorsal hump if you are going to do an asthetic natural looking rhinoplasty. However, there is really no such thing as a simple hump removal in most cases because one has to place the dorsum and tip in harmony with the rest of the face.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2375" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-4a0a93f39a9476b03c5b55470ebe86a4">

</div><p>If it is just a simple dorsal hump removal, one can do that endo-nasally to rasp it down, but in most cases it requires an open rhinoplasty to refine the nasal tip and the dorsum to produce a natural looking nose. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Reducing a nasal hump</h3><p>Assessing your pictures, I can notice that probably a hump reduction could enhance your droopy nose appearance. So it would be recommended perform computer imaging during your consultation, it can demonstrate you if you would need a tip reposition or not. Reducing portion of the hump should be considered major surgery. Both the bony and cartilaginous vaults of the nose contribute to a dorsal nasal hump.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2377" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-056b452d0be00971c3be6f3afc00ca18">

</div><p>Refinement of the dorsal area could be accomplished through either closed or open rhinoplasty, it depends on surgeon experience. However, whenever significant dorsal reduction has been performed, osteotomies are required to prevent open roof deformities, that is why you can get light bruising after surgery. I suggest that before undergoing the surgery, you seek more than one surgeon. (Cynthia Nicolau, MD, Brazil Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Reducing a dorsal hump</h3><p>Reducing a dorsal hump during a rhinoplasty is one of the most common maneuvers performed to improve the aesthetics of the nose and is relatively straight-forward. It would be helpful to see a profile photograph of your nose in order to render an opinion on how extensive a change it might be.</p><p>Based on the photos you have submitted, you might also be a candidate for slight shortening the nose to elevate the tip somewhat. (Roger J. Oldham, MD, Bethesda Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Removing a bump on the dorsum of the nose</h3><p>Reducing the dorsal bump of the nose is one of the most frequently performed procedures in rhinoplasty. Small bumps can often be treated by reducing the bone and cartilage directly beneath the bump.</p><p>Large bumps may require reduction and repositioning of the remain supportive structures to avoid making a flat spot on the nasal dorsum. This is usually a simple procedure.</p><p>Computer imaging is very helpful in these cases. While it cannot be a guarantee of results, it can greatly facilitate the decision of how much reduction is enough.</p><p>By defining the goal before surgery, the chances of a result you will be happy with are greatly increased. (Joseph Mele, MD, Walnut Creek Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty for nasal refinement.</h3><p>This is not difficult but you need to go to an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon who does natural noses that are not over done. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dorsal hump reduction</h3><p>A small dorsal hump may be easy to treat and sometimes do not require an osteotomy at the end of surgery.</p><p>A full exam is essential to figure out what you would need. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Subtle dorsal hump removal</h3><p>A subtle dorsal hump removal can be done while maintaining the other aspects of your nose, if you want. As others have mentioned, it is important to assess whether you would be at risk for pinching of the middle third of your nose as a result of surgery.</p><p>If this is the case, cartilage spreader grafts can be placed concurrently to add support to the area and prevent this problem (aesthetically and functionally). It may be illustrative to go through computer morphing with your surgeon to see what extent of change exactly you’re looking for.</p><p>This also allows your surgeon to know that you do indeed want the other aspects of your nose to stay the same. (Thomas A. Lamperti, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Hump Reduction: Best to Consider the Nose and Face as a Whole</h3><p>Reduction of a nasal hump is a very common maneuver performed as part of a Rhinoplasty. What’s more important however is to determine what reducing the hump will do to the overall appearance of the nose and face. It’s hard to tell from the angles in the photos provided, but it seems that you may have some tip ptosis. Sometimes some slight tip elevation in conjunction with hump reduction can make the nose look much more natural than just taking the hump down. I would suggest you have a computer imaging session with your surgeon of choice and see what the different options would look like for you. (Thomas Buonassisi, MD, Vancouver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Procedure to Reduce Dorsal Hump</h3><p>A very limited dorsal hump can be addressed with rasping and possibly shaving the cartilage but in reality the total balance of the nose should be considered when one alters even one aspect ot the nasal structure. (Erel Laufer, MD, Dunedin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The only minor surgery is the one done on someone else</h3><p>On the grand scheme of things, the reduction of a dorsal hump is relatively simple compared to other problems in rhinoplasty. That being said, the decision to perform this procedure without manipulating other parts of the nose can be tricky. I agree that it is very important to have your surgeon perform computerized imaging so you can see how reducing the hump will make other parts of your nose look a little different as well. (Colin Pero, MD, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A slight reduction of the nasal dorsum</h3><p>What you might need is more than a slight filing down of the dorsal hump. It might, by itself, create a nose that is less attractive and fitting for your face. See a surgeon who employs computer imaging to get a preview of what your nose might look like with the various maneuvers that can be done. (Sheldon S. Kabaker, MD, Oakland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Simple nasal hump reduction</h3><p>It is possible to reduce the nasal hump in a ‘simple’ procedure, and the concept came out of LA many years ago (where else) and was called the lunch hour rhinoplasty.</p><p>In short, you can reduce and shape the hump and keep the rest of your nose. The lunch hour thing though is a bad idea. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
