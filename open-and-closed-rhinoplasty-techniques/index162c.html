Since over the internet we can not examine the intra nasal appearance for the septal issue, than an opinion from one of us is useless./ (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open or closed rhinoplasty</h3><p>There is a small dorsal hump which can be shaved. I need to see the frontal view to evaluate the tip.You definitely need a chin implant to improve your profile.</p><p>Not only the the radix ( the area between the eyes), need to be reduced but also the area at the columella and the upper lip needs to be refined.</p><p>If the tip is OK, then a closed rhinoplasty can be done. (Mohsen Tavoussi, MD, DO, Newport Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open or closed, the plan matters</h3><p>You can have an excellent result with open or closed rhinoplasty. What matters is the look after the procedure. Your nose is indeed over projected, and the nasal spine (the curve at the base from lip to columella) is also prominent.</p><p>Computer imaging will help sort out the details of the look just right for you. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is a common question, and the answer is that it depends on what you want to have done. For cases where the primary goal is just removal of a bump on the bridge, a closed approach is an excellent option.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3233" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>However, if you want specific changes to the shape of the tip (less bulbous, shorter, etc.), in my opinion, these are much better addressed in an open approach.</p><p>The most important thing is to find a surgeon that fits your personality and goals. (Evan Ransom, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Female rhinoplasty open or closed?</h3><p>Female rhinoplasty open or closed? This is a question asked often. Being one of the pioneers of open rhinoplasty more than 35 years ago I see this done too often now. What u need is a very natural result done by an experienced surgeon, open or closed! (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3232" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b21d954b140adb9454616895c4a5225f">

</div><p>Having an open vs closed rhinoplasty depends on the goals you are trying to achieve. Because you are having difficulty breathing from one side and a history of trauma to the nose, the first recommendation is to have an in-person consultation where the inside and outside of your nose can be thoroughly examined.</p><p>Next, 3-dimensional computer imaging can help you visualize what you may look like with the changes you seek. Please consult with a board certified specialist in the face who can help you achieve the results you seek.</p><p>Because you have a breathing issue, it would be advised to seek a facial plastic surgeon who has training in head and neck surgery who can address both the breathing and aesthetic aspects. (Kimberly Lee, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed vs Open</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3234" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>You would be a great candidate for both open and closed rhinoplasty. The approach will be based on the comfort level of the surgeon. I like to perform open rhinoplasties when tip work is needed, otherwise a hump reduction can easily be done by a closed approach. Based on your profile photos, it looks like you would benefit from a hump reduction and slight tip rotation. (Eugene Kim, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open or Closed Rhinoplasty Question</h3><p>The technique used by the surgeon you choose is up to the surgeon and what he/she is most comfortable with to procure the best results for the patient. I personally do the majority of my procedures with an open approach. With 30 years of rhinoplasty expertise I have found little to no revisions in the past 20 years using an open approach. For me the technique allows the ability for a more precise result that is very comparable to my patients proposed digital imaging result.</p><p>As far as your breathing issues upon examination your surgeon will determine if you need work done on your septum and/or turbinates. The perfect rhinoplasty or septorhinoplasty as we call it, is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. To attain the proper balance and aesthetics to your face you may want to consider a small chin augmentation with your rhinoplasty. (Michael Elam, MD, Orange County Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open vs Closed</h3><p>I would not choose your surgeon on the basis of if they do closed or open. Each technique has it advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>The technique chosen should be based on your anatomy and what needs to be addressed.</p><p>There are some things that open rhinoplasty is better for, and it does not matter how much experience the surgeon has doing the closed.</p><p>You just need to choose your surgeon carefully but not solely based on the if they do open or closed. (Farbod Esmailian, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open versus closed rhinoplasty</h3><p>Your observation is a good one, but don’t choose your plastic surgeon solely based on the before and after photos. Rhinoplasty can be done open or closed, as you know, but when a significant amount of work needs to be done open rhinoplasty may be a better choice.</p><p>Yet, if you are comfortable with your surgeon, you like his/her results (closed or open rhinoplasty), and you know what results you are looking for then you’re ready! (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What is the best approach for Rhinoplasty?</h3><p>I think that you may have noticed better results with closed rhinoplasties because of a selection bias. Closed rhinoplasty is often chosen for more simple noses.</p><p>The open approach is more often used in cases where there is assymetry or in cases of revision rhonoplasties. Having said that, I aggree that as surgeons become more experienced, they may tackle more nose jobs through a closed approach.</p><p>Certainly, more experienced surgeons have better surgical outcomes. (Maurice M. Khosh, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Natural Rhinoplasty results are what counts</h3><p>Interesting observation. You have discovered one of the truths of cosmetic nasal surgery: experience counts. The operation is the most technically challenging in all the world of cosmetic surgery. Superior training, experience and an ” aesthetic sense” (inherent sense of what looks right) are the hallmarks of the most accomplished cosmetic nasal surgeons.</p><p>What technique the surgeon uses should not be a criterion for doctor selection. For all cosmetic procedures, it’s only about results.</p><p>Today, prospective patients are fortunate to be able to see galleries of results on cosmetic surgeons’ websites. And, can scrutinize photos at the office consultation.</p><p>You are doing the right homework. (Robert Kotler, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed versus open rhinoplasty</h3><p>Choose a surgeon based upon the quality of his results. Open or closed doesn’t matter. My preference is open because I think there is more control and therefore more consistency in delivering great results. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Closed rhinoplasty surgeons are generally older and therefore may have more experience just on the basis of their number of years in practice.</p><p>As mentioned by another respondent, the open approach didn’t come into favor until the late 80’s or even early 90’s.</p><p>Of course, there is no scientific evidence to show who gets better results, open or closed. (Kenneth R. Francis, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would vigorously challenge the idea that those who do closed Rhinoplasty have better results. I have now done almost 2000 Open Rhinoplasties over the past 27 years.</p><p>Please look at the pictures on our website as I believe that they compare favorably with anyone doing primarily closed Rhinoplasty.</p><p>Historically I trained with the physician who is generally given credit in this country for popularizing the open rhinoplasty.</p><p>Dr Anderson did 10,000 closed rhinoplaasties prior to 1981 but stopped doing closed rhinoplasty after discovering the open technique.</p><p>There is a good reason for that! Recent studies have shown that over 75% of the Rhinoplasties currently done in the US are done by the open technique. There is a good reason for that! (S. Randolph Waldman, MD, Lexington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What’s better Open vs Closed Rhinoplasty</h3><p>The short answer is both approaches are good and in the hands of a skilled and experienced rhinoplasty surgeon, the results should be equal.</p><p>Having said that, in my practice, I perform about 60% open and 40% closed. My criteria is based on how much work needs to be done on the tip. If significant modification is required then we do it as an open approach. This is simply based on exposure that it takes to build good structure and stable modification of the cartilaginous framework.  (Amir M. Karam, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Success, Dependent on Closed or Open Approach?</h3><p>The simple answer to your question is no. Open or closed is just an approach to rhinoplasty. What determines the results is the rhinoplasty surgeon’s skill, experience, attention to detail, and aesthetic sense of beauty and proportions. Do choose your rhinoplasty surgeon carefully. (Michael A. Persky, MD, Encino Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed versus open</h3><p>Closed vs. open rhinoplasty is dependent on visualization needed to change the structures of the nose and the difficulty of the changes being made. Some surgeons feel very at ease with the closed approach for most of their cases, while others use the open approach because of the need to directly visualize the structures.</p><p>Another issue is that teaching and learning the closed approach is more difficult. Thus, some older surgeons don’t rely as much on the open approach. One caveat is that the open approach may prolong tip swelling, though the overall results are generally no different than the closed approach. (Ricardo Izquierdo, MD, Oak Brook Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed vs Open Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Experience is VERY important in rhinoplasty surgery. However, the technique used does not tell you anything about experience. I have used both approaches for 30 years. Does that make me experienced? Pick the experienced surgeon whose results you like. You are smart to thoroughly explore your alternatives. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
