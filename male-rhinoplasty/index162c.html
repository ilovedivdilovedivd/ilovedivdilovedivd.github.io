These are factored in in the pre-op planning. The skin of the nose is generally thicker in a male which influences the convalescence and final result. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The desired RESULTS are the main difference</h3><p>There are different aesthetic dimensions that are considered masculine and feminine. For example, a prominent dorsum in more appropriate for a male nose while a softer nose is more feminine. As far as the surgery, there is little difference in the techniques between men and women. (Babak Azizzadeh, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Male Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Male rhinoplasty is significantly different than female rhinoplasty. The technique is similar but the end results are dramatically different if it is done correctly. A common error is to feminize a male nose and make it disproportionate to a larger masculine face. A male nose should be fuller and not have any or very little of a supra tip break.</p><p>The male nose should maintain its masculinity in the overall shape and contour. This is the art and science of rhinoplasty techniques and each patient’s facial features and skin thickness should be taken into consideration in the consultation and planning phases of the surgery. Computer Imaging is very important in rhinoplasty procedures as a pre-operative educational tool as it helps the patient and the physician communicate the desired results (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Male rhinoplasty is very different from female rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2034" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The surgery itself is not very different between men and women. The steps that a surgeon takes are essentially the same. The primary difference is the shape of the nasal dorsum, the rotation of the nasal tip, and the sharpness of the nasal tip. There are other subtle differences including the take-off at the root of the nose.</p><p>Women tend to have a gentle slope to their dorsum, where men tend to have a straighter dorsum. The nasal tip is rotated between 95-105 degrees in women and is essentially 90 degrees in men. Women can tolerate a finer nasal tip, where men need a little more separation between the nasal tip defining points. But, the actual surgery is about the same. (Raghu Athre, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty in men vs. women: The difference is mostly aesthetic.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2036" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a7a839d44366153014a3b66711350c40">

</div><p>For me, the biggest difference is aesthetic. On side view, men should have a straight nasal bridge and the nasal tip should not be upturned at all. In women, there can be a slight curve to the bridge and the tip can have a slight upturn to give a more feminine look. In terms of the technical aspects of surgery, many of the maneuvers are the same for both men and women.</p><p>Men often have thicker skin which can limit how much refinement can be obtained in the nasal tip. This usually is not a problem, however, as too narrow a nasal tip may be feminizing. The overall goal for both is the same: to create better harmony between the nose and face, and thereby accentuate other facial features. (Anand D. Patel, MD, Brookfield Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty In Men Looks to Achieve a Nice “Male” Nose</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2035" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-776df262a4772db4178d1ca60b035920">

</div><p>There is no technical difference in how a rhinoplasty is performed in a man versus a woman. The approach is the same. The difference lies in exactly what shape you “carve” the nose into. Just like a sculptor will use the same raw materials and same tools to carve a female bust or a male bust. The recovery is also expected to be the same. (Louis W. Apostolakis, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Male Rhinoplasty versus women</h3><p>The rhinoplasty maneuvers themselves aren’t different for men versus women. However, the aesthetic goals are typically different. Men’s noses tend to have a stronger profile line, somewhat more tip projection, less tip rotation (i.e., not as upturned), and thicker nasal skin. It’s important that you review before and after photographs of your potential rhinoplasty surgeon to see that you agree with their male rhinoplasty aesthetic.</p><p>I find that by performing computer morphing with my patients before surgery allows me to best understand what changes my patients are interested in achieving. There is no one set ideal for any nose but rather should be guided by patient preference and achieving facial balance. (Thomas A. Lamperti, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Men versus women in rhinoplasty</h3><p>Rhinoplasty should aim to make the rest of the facial features more attractive. Beauty and handsomeness have been well studied (“Survival of the Prettiest” is a good read on the science of beauty), and so there are many differences in the ideal male and female face.</p><p>Keep in mind that there are many individual differences amongst all of us including ethnicity, personality, goals, and personal likes. The surgeon should be able to work with you to help create a nose which fits you.</p><p>Computer imaging and demonstration of a surgeon’s aesthetic by before and after photographs can be helpful as well. (Anil R. Shah, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty should be different for men and woman</h3><p>The rhinoplasty surgeon should have an idea of what can make any particular patient look better. In particular, there are certain characteristics of nasal asthetics that correspond to a woman and others that correspond to a man.</p><p>For example, the tip on a woman should be rotated higher than in a man. Consult with a surgeon that can explain these differences to you. (Andres Bustillo, MD, FACS, )</p><h3>Rhinoplasty is not as different in Men and Women as it used to be</h3><p>In general there are still differences in the goals and ideal outcomes for shapes between men and women.</p><p>Men’s noses tend to be larger, have a “stronger” profile, one that is either straight, or even with a slight convexity, and the rotation of the tip is less. (Meaning a ideal male nose isn’t up in the air.) And obviously, it stands to reason, the ideal woman’s nose is the opposite of the above, smaller, slightly concave on profile and sometimes more rotated. However, the trend has been for women to have stronger noses. (Think Angelina Jolie vs. Sissy Spacek)</p><p>Women today are requesting smooth contours and proportions to their noses, but still keeping some strength. The may want slight concavities, but not necessarily the “ski sloped” nose. The ideal male nose is still strong. Men don’t look good with tiny tips, over rotated, or too skinny. For more info on Rhinoplasty, please click the link below. (David Mabrie, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty varies based on the look desired</h3><p>The surgery is the same. However, the desired look may be different for a male. Men less frequently desire an upturned tip and do not want the nose to be too small. The nose must relate harmoniously to the rest of the face.</p><p>Really it is a question of explaining to the surgeon the desired result and allowing the surgeon to help you choose the changes that will most achieve the look you desire. (Robert Mounsey, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Men vs Women</h3><p>Rhinoplasty surgery can be different in men. Although the techniques are the same (general anesthesia, approach, incisions, suturing, grafting, etc.), the goals can be very different. Most men do not look good with a “cute” nose.a masculine nose is the goal. Less aggressive removal over the hump, less width reduction, keeping the angle between the lip and tip less obtuse or pushed up to mention a few differences. Rhinoplasty exudes precision and exemplifies the art and science of surgery. I recommend you find a surgeon (or 2) who performs a significant number of rhinoplasties in both men and women and get their opinion; ask alot of questions until you are comfortable. Review their pics of male rhinoplasty. Pictures are worth a thousand words and I think this will help you too. (John Philip Connors III, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Differences in Rhinoplasty for Men vs. Women</h3><p>First of all, as an elective aesthetic procedure, men have different goals than women where the nasal tip should not be as upwardly rotated, a bump can be fine, and the overall appearance of the nose should generally be “larger”.</p><p>Now those of course are generalizations, and every patient has different goals, but these are just to name a few.</p><p>This is a part of the procedure where not only an experienced surgeon is important, especially working on males, but also illustrates the importance of computer imaging, where each patient can get a realistic idea of what his or her appearance will look like afterwards.</p><p>In terms of the technical aspects, men tend to have thicker skin and stronger bones than women, so the ability to refine the tip may be a bit less, and breaking the bones (osteotomies) to set them in can be a bit more difficult, and in many of these cases, the bones first need to be weakened a bit with filing. (Jeffrey Epstein, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
