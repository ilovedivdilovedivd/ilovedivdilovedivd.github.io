<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Dorsum straightening can be done closed</h3><p>Working on the dorsum alone will give you a much better shape to your nose. This can be done through a closed approach with incisions only inside the nostrils. If you are not interested in anything with the tip then this is the approach I would take. When tip work is involved I prefer to do the procedure open to have better control of the final tip shape.</p><p>In either cases the recovery is not bad at all. With the open technique it does take a bit longer for the swelling of the tip to go down. Another tool I have found very helpful when planning rhinoplasty is computer imaging. With that the patient and i can see what can realistically be accomplished and you could see what it would look like with only the hump smoothed.</p><p>I use that in my office in La Jolla with great success. (Robert B. Pollack, MD, La Jolla Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open vs Closed Rhinoplasty to fix nose hump</h3><p>This is a question to the surgeon you have chosen. I do both techniques but I have specific citeria on why I personally use each technique. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open versus closed rhinoplasty</h3><p>You could have either an open or closed rhinoplasty; every surgeon has or his or her own preference. I personally would opt for an open approach to address your tip in addition to the hump.</p><p>Open rhinoplasty does not require significantly longer time for healing, but your tip may be swollen for a bit longer than with a closed approach.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2410" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-cc88f30cd85a6ec7e8555c2e66622829">

</div><p>Every patient is different, so it’s hard to give you an exact time frame. With either approach, you can expect to have some minor swelling for up to a year. I don’t think achieving your dream nose will require anything drastic at all. (Nina S. Naidu, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed Approach Can Reduce Nasal Hump</h3><p>You can easily have the nasal hump reduced and the tip turned upwards with a closed approach. The approach usually is a preference of the surgeon. Many surgeons are not trained to do a closed approach and will prefer to use open approach. The healing time is definitely greater with open approach. However at the end of the day it is more important to have a good surgeon than to have the closed approach. (Tanveer Janjua, MD, Bedminster Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Downtime after Open Rhinoplasty Surgery is less than 2 weeks.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2411" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-16b7d9538b3f4d487a142a265db14115">

</div><p>You appear to have a long nose, with a droopy tip, as well as a profile hump. I don’t think you’d get the best possible aesthetic result with only hump reduction. You might consider tip deprojection and rotation, along with nasal shortening, and hump removal. Nearly all patients requesting Rhinoplasty Surgery benefit from tip modification that is routinely performed at the time of surgery. My preference is the open approach for Rhinoplasty; in my experience it leads to predictable results, and happy, satisfied patients.</p><p>Downtime is minimal after Rhinoplasty Surgery using the open approach. Our makeup specialist matches your foundation before surgery, and bruising is easily camouflaged with a post-op concealer kit. Your bruising would be comparable with either the open or closed approach since you would require osteotomies after your hump is removed. Your satisfaction with your Rhinoplasty Surgery is dependent on your surgeon, so be picky, and choose wisely. You should interview several board-certified, experienced Rhinoplasty specialists with many photos. You should request to see computer-imaging to get a good idea of how you’ll look after surgery.

Joseph, MD, West Orange Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2412" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d87d550619663a1157fa2e6f7e0b1eb5">

</div><h3>Closed Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Your goals for your nose can be all accomplished via the closed rhinoplasty technique, and it will not take a lot of drastic work. You have an attractive face and you want your nose to fit your face. Open approach is not necessary. (Mehryar (Ray) Taban, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open versus Closed Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Based on your pictures, it looks like closed rhinoplasty will work well for you. However, it is hard to tell without personally examining you. However, both open and closed rhinoplasty are appropriate procedures. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CLOSED vs OPEN Rhinoplasty (Nose Job)</h3><p>The surgical incisions used in a Rhinoplasty (Nose Job) depend BOTH the on the goals of the operation and on the surgeon’s preference.</p><p>There are 3 different INTERNAL (IE only seen by looking inside the nose) incisions commonly used to shape the tip of nose and its back (dorsum).</p><p>There are 2 INTERNAL incisions used to shape the nasal septum. There are other incisions used to treat the turbinates and flaring nostrils.</p><p>IF only INTERNAL incisions are used in a nose job, regardless of how many incisions we use, we refer to the nose job as a CLOSED RHINOPLASTY.</p><p>On the other hand several of the intranasal incisions can be extended across the waist of the columella (the fleshy separator of the two nostrils).</p><p>The small external transcolumellar incision allows the surgeon to see the WHOLE nose (without going side to side.</p><p>It allows several procedures that cannot be done as well using closed techniques.</p><p>This incision heals extremely well and becomes virtually invisible in most people.</p><p>Placing such an incision makes it an OPEN Rhinoplasty. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>No outside incisions with closed rhinoplasty.</h3><ol>
<li>We do most rhinoplasty closed, because there is no need for the additional scar. Closed means that the whole operation is done from inside the nostrils.</li>
<li>When a patient has complicated anatomy or a difficult tip, then it is a good idea to use the “open” approach.</li>
<li>The open approach is easier and so it is favored by younger surgeons. This is not a bad thing, because the scar is hardly noticeable, and it is safer in less experienced hands. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Healing time about equal for open or closed rhinoplasty</h3><p>Open rhinoplasty has become more popular due to its accuracy of the long term result.</p><p>There recovery time is more dependant upon what is done below, rather than the approach: open or closed. (Barry E. DiBernardo, MD, Montclair Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nasal hump reduction</h3><p>An open versus a closed approach refers to the access used to perform the rhinoplasty. Most rhinoplasties can be performed via a closed approach.</p><p>You are correct in that tip swelling takes longer to resolve with an open versus a closed approach.</p><p>For something like a hump reduction, my preference is a closed approach since I reserve open approaches for revision rhinoplasties, significant tip alterations or grafting neither of which you would seem to need. (Scott Trimas, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed versus Open Approach to Rhinoplasty</h3><p>It appears that a closed approach can be used in your rhinoplasty to achieve your desired results.<br>
a<br>
More important than the approach (open versus closed) you should be concerned about the skill and results of the rhinoplasty surgeon that you choose. Take your time and carefully choose your surgeon. (Michael A. Persky, MD, Encino Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Open vs. closed</h3><p>It depends on the surgeon rather than the technique to achive the best result. There is nothing wrong with either procedure and some doctors state that thir result is because of the technique and not their surgical skills. Please get more than one consultation and let your doctor offer their opinion on the technique before you say anything about close or open. I myself do both but the results from open rhinoplsty are more predictable. (Kamran Khoobehi, MD, New Orleans Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>See a plastic surgeon for your dream nose</h3><p>You need to be seen and examined. Open or closed depends usually on the experience of the surgeon. I am an older experienced surgeon who does 95% of his rhinoplasties via a closed approach. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>In primary rhinoplasty most changes can be done just as well through a closed approach</h3><p>Especially if the main goal is to reduce a large hump. Most alterations on the nose, including rotating a drooping nasal tip, narrowing a wide nasal tip and even getting a mildly crooked nose straighter can be performed with equal accuracy through an endonasal or closed approach.</p><p>I have specific reasons why I might choose to use an open approach for a primary rhinoplasty, which comprises about 10% of my cases.</p><p>However, many superb rhinoplasty surgeons do all their cases through an open approach and get great results as well as many getting great results through a closed approach. The choice of an incision will not determine results but the skill of the surgeon and their procedure of choice. (Steven J. Pearlman, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Closed versus Open Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Patients can get excellent results with both Open and Closed Rhinoplasty. The disadvantage of Open Rhinoplasty is a scar along the columella. Closed Rhinoplasty is a more difficult operation, and requires more experience – but I believe leads to an equally good result without an external scar. Ask your Plastic Surgeon which method HE/SHE feels is best in thier hands and proceed forward. (Richard Greco, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty technique</h3><p>The most important thing with your nose is to get the shape change that you desire. Make sure you are communicating with your surgeon well. The open or closed technique is not significant if you get the look and change that you want.</p><p>The recovery is dependant on the manipulation of the bone and cartilage structures, not on the small incision across the columella. (Marcus L. Peterson, MD, Saint George Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
