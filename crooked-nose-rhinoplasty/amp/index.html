Still healing pursues for a year.</p><p>The surgeon’s asssessment at the time of surgery is most important in these cases. (Ben Talei, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Generally speaking, it can take 6 to 12 months to completely heal after surgery. Please keep in touch with your surgeon or his/her clinical team to discuss your ongoing concerns. (Ross A. Clevens, MD, Melbourne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked nose</h3><p>I appreciate that this answer is being answered years after being initially asked. The structures of the nose are complex and difficult to fully correct. Without photos it would always be difficult to give appropriate answers. I would advice the patient to wait several months after correction surgery to make a final judgement, and certainly always ask the same questions( and more) of the patient’s treating surgeon (Francis (Frank) William Rieger, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nasal asymmetry after rhinoplasty</h3><p><a href="../../swelling-after-rhinoplasty/index.html" target="_blank">Swelling after rhinoplasty</a> can appear to make the nose look uneven or deviated early on. Apart from swelling it is possible that the splint application resulted in a little more pressure on one side – in either case re-splinting the nose for another week can be very helpful.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1966" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-370eebd5cd2867caf195e5e39bee18dd">

</div><p>Uneven swelling can take weeks and months to fully subside.Rhinoplasty surgeons do their best to ensure symmetry at each level – upper third (nasal bones), middle third cartilage, lower third (nasal tip) cartilage) – before the surgery is completed.</p><p>Significant asymmetry that does not go away on its own or respond to treatment may ultimately require another procedure at some point. (J. David Holcomb, MD, Sarasota Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked nose after rhinoplasty</h3><p>It is impossible to know how much of the crooked appearance is due to swelling but it is very common to see asymmetries related to swelling after the bandage is removed. Swelling is almost always uneven so it is best to be patient and allow the healing process to continue. As time goes on if it is persisting it is important to discuss this with your surgeon.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1965" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Importantly, no ones nose is perfectly symmetric but if there are more visible asymmetries there may be several easy nonsurgical options to address it once you are further out from surgery. (Robert Glasgold, MD, East Brunswick Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling After Rhinoplasty</h3><p>With a rhinoplasty, it is important to have patience! What you are seeing as crooked could just be swelling and time will tell. Remember, it can take up to a year for all the swelling in the nose to dissipate.</p><p>Straightening a crooked nose is difficult and getting a perfectly straight nose is not alway possible. A straighter nose is generally the goal. Give it time to heal and let the swelling go down. You’ll have a better idea as to what the results will truly look like in a few months. (Amir M. Karam, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked, Uneven, Asymmetric Appearance After Rhinoplasty Nose Surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1964" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Following rhinoplasty surgery it is almost always the case that there is more swelling on one side than the other. This can fluctuate throughout the day, and in fact change sides from one day to next. This is most profound during the first month after surgery. Between one and 3 months after surgery these large changes settle down quite quickly, but the final results are not visible until 9-12 months following surgery.</p><p>At one week following surgery having just had a splint removed it is quite likely that what you are seeing is a result of some uneven swelling. If you are concerned, it is best to review this with her surgeon so that he or she can reassure you and keep close track of your recovery. If there is a need for revision, most surgeons would consider this at around 9 months from surgery. (Cory Goldberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked Nose Immediately post Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Patients are excited after having had their surgery. They understand that there is post-operative swelling. How much swelling and how much patience a patient has with their healing varies. Most feel that once the cast is removed, much like a wrapped present, they will have the gift of a new nose.</p><p>Unfortunately, removing a cast is not like unwrapping a present, there is often black and blue discoloration, sometimes yellowish skin color changes and swelling that may be equal on the left and the right or unequal.</p><p>Although I discuss this with patients prior to their surgery, they still expect their “uncasted” nose to be near their healed result. Unfortunately it is difficult to have patience when you are the patient. I help allay these times of anxiety and trepidation with photographs on each visit.</p><p>Patients then can see their healing changes over the several weeks and months. When they look in the mirror each and every day after their surgery, they often do not see the subtle changes that are occuring. By showing them their photographs, they are reassured that they are healing. This seems to work with my patients. (Jonathan Berman, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>After Rhinoplasty, crooked nose after cast comes off not uncommon</h3><p>After rhinoplasty the nose will swell asymmetrically and heal at different rates that make the nose appear as if it is crooked when It likely is not. It will take up to 6 months to a year to see the final result so it will take a lot of patience. (Andrew Jacono, MD, Great Neck Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Asymmetry Early After A Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Swelling takes time to dissipate after a rhinoplasty. Allow some time for the swelling to go down for more critical evaluation of your nose. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked nose and nose job</h3><p>If you had a displaced nasal fracture, surgery would be the open open. When you ask whether the bones can be “rebroken”, reduction of a nasal fracture can be accomplished in the first few days after a trauma, either by an open or closed approach, but at this point, you would need surgery.</p><p>The extent of that surgery would depend on the internal and external condition of the nose, whether septoplasty or SMR would be required and the degree of reconstruction required. This can be assessed during a consultation with a plastic surgeon. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When and how to fix a broken nose.</h3><p>the best time to reposition fractured nasal bones is within a two week period after the initial injury. If done during that time period,the bones can be manipulated back into their original position and no need for aggressive surgery or re-breaking up the bones are necessary. However, once the bones have healed, the only way to reposition them is to fracture them again. (Philip Miller, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to straighten a crooked nose</h3><p>Unfortunately, at this point the nose would need to be re-fractured and straightened out. The problem may lie iin whether or not the septum needs to be straightened as well, and this can only be determined by seeing a qualified plastic or facial plastic surgeon experienced in nose job. I have to agree with my colleagues that surgery is the only answer, but get several opinions before proceeding. (Steven Schuster, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your only option is surgery at this point. The surgeon will need to “rebreak” the nose, but in a controlled surgical way (call osteotomies). In addition, the inside septum may be crooked and need to be treated surgically. (David Alessi, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Straightening a crooked nose</h3><p>A surgeon can rebreak and straighten your nose, but that is the same thing as having surgery. Straightening the nose without surgery only works when done soon after the trauma, before the bones and cartilage have healed in the incorrect position.</p><p>In such an instance, the surgeon is not “rebreaking”, but rather is realigning the nose in a procedure called a “closed reduction of nasal fracture”. Also, it may be more than just your nasal bones that were injured.</p><p>You may have also injured your septum, which will also give the appearance of a crooked nose. Your best bet is consulting with a board certified plastic surgeon or facial plastic/ENT surgeon to do a physical exam in order to provide you with your options.</p><p>Many surgeons don’t charge a first consultation fee, so take advantage of that opportunity. If you absolutely cannot afford surgery, sometimes a filler such as Restylance can be injected to camoflouge (not fix) a contour irregularity like a bump. (Anita Patel, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A crooked nose is often more than just crooked bones</h3><p>To directly answer your question, a surgeon can “rebreak and straighten” your nose. But a crooked nose is often more than just crooked bones.</p><p>A complete Septorhinoplasty may be needed and that depends on how the cartilage of the rest of your nose was affected by your accident. This can only be determined with a consult to discuss your options. Best Wishes. (Travis T. Tollefson, MD, MPH, Sacramento Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Can my Healed Broken Crooked Nose Only be Straightened via Surgery?</h3><p>At this particular time surgery is your only option. In the very short window of 2 weeks from the time of injury your nasal fracture is still mobile and amendable to repositioning. So at this particular time an operation is necessary to refracture the nose in a controlled manner and reset the nasal bones.</p><p>To be fair, however, often times even if you had been seen in the short term.</p><p>A quick closed nasal reduction often doesn’t cut it from a results standpoint and it is not uncommon that we wait 6-8 weeks to let the swelling subside and plan on this type of procedure as the results are more predictable and the outcomes are usually far superior.</p><p>You haven’t lost anything by waiting to have it repaired. See a board certified surgeon who is comfortable with nasal surgery and you may even discover that the insurance plan will cover the problem due to the nature of the injury. (Shepherd G. Pryor, MD, Scottsdale Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Straightening a healed broken crooked nose</h3><p>A broken nose will remain crooked unless it is reset properly by osteotomies, which is re-breaking the nasal bones in a very controlled fashion. Both medial and lateral osteotomies are performed while the patient is under general anesthesia. A cast will then be applied across the bridge of the nose and left in place for approximately 1 week. Any bruising from the surgery typically resolves after 14 days. It is also important to make sure the septum is not deviated at the internal portion of the nose, which may or may not need to be addressed at the time of the surgery.
