The first factor is the fact that the curvature of the cartilage and bone tissue have a certain level of memory. Cartilaginous tissue always retains a tendency to return to its original position.</p><p>There is a natural tension in the cartilaginous structures and soft tissues(shortened muscles and connective tissue on the side of the curve), while continuing to operate on the nose after rhinoplasty, which makes it difficult achieve excellent results after surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5567" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is important to keep in mind that a completely straight nose is a very difficult task. After a significant improvement the nose can have a residual deviation or a small asymmetry. A small curvature is acceptable. The most a complicated goal is to make frontal view a symmetrical, since the incident light casts shadows, and the nose may look asymmetrical.</p><p>There are many reasons why the nose can become curved after rhinoplasty. This may be the result of drift of the nasal bone and / or asymmetric swelling of the soft tissue. Healing after rhinoplasty is a dynamic process.</p><p>The intensity of postoperative swelling may also vary in different parts of the nasal structures. Most of the swelling after rhinoplasty disappears within a month. Much more time is needed to resolve the final 20% of the swelling, up to a year or longer after surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5564" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The final result of the surgery can be achieved after 18-24 months.

</div><p>The curvature may result from the excessive removal of cartilage on one side. The deviation of the nasal septum can be fixed. Secondary rhinoplasty may include transplantation of cartilages.</p><p>Some surgeons recommend the injection of fillers to correct asymmetry or postoperative irregularities. However, such injections increase the risk of scarring that may jeopardize the success of a possible secondary rhinoplasty. Permanent fillers hamper the subsequent receipt of a smooth contour of the nose. Temporary fillers are absorbed by the body after 8 to 12 months.</p><p>The end result of rhinoplasty can be seen after 12 months of observation. If after surgery of the nose curvature persists, should wait 6-9 months before you start the secondary rhinoplasty. Too early surgery can lead to new problems. Five-year period for a rhinoplasty may be sufficient to assess the long-term results.</p></div>
