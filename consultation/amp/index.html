(Robert Mounsey, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Questions to ask your doctor about rhinoplasty</h3><p>It’s important that you and your doctor be on the same page about your concerns and expectations. Your doctor should be able to explain an analysis of your nasal bones, bridge and tip.</p><p>She should be able to explain any functional findings, such as a deviated septum, or hypertrophied turbinates, that should be addressed during your surgery.</p><p>It is important for you to let your doctor know what is and isn’t a concern; for example, a slight bump may be very attractive (look at Meryl Streep)</p><p>You should ask what internal changes will be made, and whether your surgeon plans to use cartilage grafts. You should ask about planned anesthesia, expected results, dressings and splints, nose care after surgery, and permitted activities.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1781" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-15f703de3983f123ee61ce5c9b664247">

</div><p>Most patients have spent a lot of time on the internet educating themselves regarding their elective surgical procedure.</p><p>I think specific questions to ask your surgeon should be:</p><ol>
<li>training and experience,</li>
<li>personal philosophy concerning changes in body image,</li>
<li>view an extensive body of their work.</li>
</ol><p>If any of these topics are avoided or seem to be brushed over, look elsewhere.</p><p>There are quite a few qualified surgeons out there and you don’t have to settle with one less qualified.

Raine, MD, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty: What to Ask</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1783" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>As there is no such thing as a stupid question, you should feel free to ask as many questions as you may have. These should include:</p><ol>
<li>Are you certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Board of Otolaryngology? (The answer should be yes!)</li>
<li>How many rhinoplasties have you performed? (The answer should be many. You want someone with experience and a special interest in performing the procedure.)</li>
<li>What are the risks/complications of rhinoplasty?</li>
<li>Can the airway (septum, etc.) be improved at the same time as the rhinoplasty is performed? How does combining these procedures affect outcome and recovery?</li>
<li>How often is revision necessary following rhinoplasty? For additional technical questions and responses, please refer to Plastic Surgery Secrets (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Rhinoplasty Questions for Your Surgeon</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1784" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-69d878c2edf505f6450abc6b78aa38f5">

</div><p>When considering Rhinoplasty, there are questions you should ask your Surgeon, and questions you should ask yourself.</p><p>The obvious questions for your Surgeon should be:</p><ol>
<li>Are you board certified by the American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery or American Board of Plastic Surgery, if so, did you complete a fellowship?</li>
<li>Do you perform Rhinoplasty frequently or occasionally?</li>
<li>Are you comfortable performing Revision Rhinoplasty, and what is your revision rate?</li>
<li>After explaining the aesthetic concerns you have with the appearance of your nose, ask your Surgeon if he/she feels they can be addressed with surgery, and if the concerns seem reasonable,</li>
<li>Ask if the proposed changes to your nose will improve or worsen your ability to breathe through your nose. In your decision making process, a certain amount of introspection is also required.</li>
</ol><p>You should consider what your motivations are for surgery: appearance, ability to breathe, or to improve a poor self image? Septorhinoplasty can certainly improve a nose functionally and aesthetically, but may or may not improve self image. Ask yourself if you are comfortable with the Surgeon, his office staff, and the results he/she has shown you. Finally ask around: does your Surgeon have a good reputation? (Stephen Prendiville, MD, Fort Myers Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Questions to ask your Facial Plastic Surgeon about Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Rhinoplasty is a procedure that requires experience. Most Facial Plastic Surgeons are well trained Rhinoplasty surgeons and understand very well the functional and aesthetic aspects of the nose.</p><p>I would inquire about the number of rhinoplasties performed, to speak with other patients, to review before and afters, whether or not packing is used, and to discuss the specific maneuvers that will be used to address your concerns.</p><p>I think it will become apparent if the doctor has the experience needed. (Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD, Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What to ask before rhinoplasty</h3><p>Well, asuming that you have read a little about the procedure, you should ask specific things that concern you about your nose.</p><p>For example, what the surgeon is going to do with the tip and the bridge. Questions regarding recovery and the time you should take off of work.</p><p>Additional questions that you should ask that pertain to the surgeon and his experience are also important.</p><p>For example, how many does he do, can you speak to his patients, and how he handles revisions. (Andres Bustillo, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What to ask your surgeon during a rhinoplasty consultation</h3><p>Important things to ask your potential rhinoplasty surgeon include:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Experience and training</strong> – you want a board certified facial plastic surgeon or plastic surgeon who has extensive rhinoplasty experience. Ask to see before and after photos of other patients the surgeon has performed surgery on (especially patients with similar issues as your own)</li>
<li>
<strong>Computer morphing</strong> to get an idea of planned surgical result.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Questions to ask before rhinoplasty</strong></p><ol>
<li>How likely is it to obtain this result</li>
<li>What are the risks of surgery and what to expect after surgery</li>
<li>How will nasal function/breathing be improved or maintained</li>
<li>What techniques are used to maximize the chances of having a long term result</li>
</ol><p>Consulting with more than one surgeon is also recommended as this will help you get a better sense of your options. There can be quite a bit of variation in treatment plans among surgeons. (Thomas A. Lamperti, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Things you should ask during consultation before rhinoplasty</h3><ol>
<li>Are you board-certified?</li>
<li>How many rhinoplasties have you done?</li>
<li>Do you do a lot of revision rhinoplasty?</li>
<li>Do you have computer modeling to discuss what my nose may look like?</li>
<li>Do you have pictures of other patients you have done?</li>
<li>Do you have references I can get in touch with?</li>
<li>Where do you operate? Is it accredited? Who does your anesthesia? Are they board-certified?</li>
<li>How long do you think my case will take?</li>
<li>Can I have copies of my preoperative and postoperative instructions? (Raghu Athre, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>If you were my brother or sister getting a rhinoplasty, this is the advice I’ld give</h3><p>I would tell you that it’s a big decision, that there are no guarantees, but you should minimize your risks by doing the following:</p><ol>
<li>See several surgeons, multiple opinions very important regarding your nose and face.</li>
<li>Ask to see a lot of before and afters with problems like yours.</li>
<li>Ask your surgeon what his/ her experience is with rhinoplasties.</li>
<li>I would tell you to make a list, prioritize them and discuss with your surgeon. Most rhinoplasties have 3-5 things that are being changed.</li>
<li>Really try to go to a surgeon who does a lot of rhinoplasties. In summary, do your research, as you obviously are if you are on Real Self, and try to pick a surgeon with a lot of before and afters, and pick the one with whom you are most comfortable after seeing 2-3 surgeons.</li>
</ol><p>For more info on Rhinoplasty, please click the link below. (David Mabrie, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The most important question to ask about rhinoplasty is how often he or she performs the procedure. You are much more likely to get a nice, natural result with a surgeon that performs rhinoplasty regularly (at least once a week) as opposed to someone that does it a few times a year.</p><p>Look for many pictures both in the office and on the internet. If you can only find a few, then it is not performed regularly. Also, ask if the surgeon has hospital privileges to perform rhinoplasty.</p><p>Hospitals require rigorous background checks to make sure the surgeon is properly qualified. Ask the name of the hospital and check it out yourself.</p><p>You can never do too much research when comes to choosing your rhinoplasty surgeon. (Andrew Miller, MD, Edison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The key to a great long lasting rhinoplasty is respected the structure of the nose. Your surgeon should have a clear focus on sculpting your nose into a new shape while maintaining its strength and structure.</p><p>Some surgeons perform reductive rhinoplasties where material is removed from the nose, but long term supporting structures are damaged. For our rhinoplasty patients who see us in Michigan, we emphasize maintaining or improving your breathing and maintaining the structure of your nose.</p><p>You do not want to be in the category of patients that need a major revision rhinoplasty because this surgery the second time can be quite difficult. Often surgeons who have an ear, nose, and throat background offer special expertise in rhinoplasty surgery. (Pramit Malhotra, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty questions to ask in consultation</h3><p>Several questions should be asked when researching a physician to perform a rhinoplasty procedure including</p><ul>
<li>how often do you perform rhinoplasty procedures?</li>
</ul><p>Rhinoplasty is a complicated surgery and should be an area of expertise for the surgeon as it is the most difficult cosmetic procedure in plastic surgery and is a surgery of millimeters.</p><ul>
<li>What type of anesthesia do you use with the surgery? Is it an outpatient procedure?</li>
<li>Can the physician perform the functional portion of the surgery as well as the aesthetic portion if necessary?</li>
</ul><p>Rhinoplasty surgeons should be able to perform both aspects of nasal surgery to maintain function as well as improve the overall shape of the nose. THE KEY ELEMENT TO HAVING A GOOD RESULT IN RHINOPLASTY IS TO FIND THE BEST AND MOST SKILLED SURGEON TO PREVENT HAVING TO DO IT OVER AGAIN ! (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Questions to ask rhinoplasty surgeon</h3><ol>
<li>How many rhinoplasty surgeries do you do a year</li>
<li>Please show me pictures of noses like mine</li>
<li>What happens if I have a complication</li>
<li>Are you board certified</li>
<li>Where will my surgery take place and what about safety (Benjamin C. Marcus, MD, Madison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Experience of your potential surgeon is the critical question to ask</h3><p>Rhinoplasty is incredibly challenging and most facial plastic surgeons will tell you the MOST challenging procedure that we perform. You want to ask about your surgeon’s background and from whom they learned rhinoplasty surgery. Ask about the number of rhinoplasties they perform and what percentage of their practice is nasal surgery. Ask about general anesthesia vs. sedation. Ask to see pre- and post-op photographs. Some surgeons will offer photo “morphing” of your pre-operative images. This can be helpful to make sure that you and your surgeon have the same vision but in most cases is not required if you feel that you and your surgeon are able to communicate well.  (Stephen Weber, MD, FACS, Denver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
