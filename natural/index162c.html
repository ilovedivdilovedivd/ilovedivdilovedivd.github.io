(Cory Goldberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Natural rhinoplasty result</h3><p>Simple: Look at before and after pictures when choosing your surgeon, and evaluate how natural the results seem to you.</p><p>If your aesthetic sense and the surgeon’s sense match, you are safe. (Steve Laverson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Natural Appearing Rhinoplasty With Hump Deformity</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2357" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>When considering rhinoplasty for a hump deformity, one must make a decision whether they would like the hump reduced or the hump and native bridge taken down in terms of height.</p><p>The goal, as in every rhinoplasty procedure, is to achieve a nose that is in harmony with the surrounding facial features. If this can be achieved by only removing the hump (and leaving the rest of the bridge height alone), that will produce the most natural appearing rhinoplasty result. If, however, the entire nose is too big for the face, it is likely you will need to have the hump removed plus further reduction of the entire bridge height. (John M. Hilinski, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The key to natural Rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2356" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A natural appearing rhinoplasty will remarkably improve your appearance. The key to this is creating a nose that is in balance with the rest of your face. Cookie cutter noses should really be a thing of the past. The key to a natural appearing rhinoplasty is to find a surgeon that has the skill and artistic eye to achieve these results. Be sure to view as many before and after rhinoplasty photos as you can in order to feel comfortable. Ask your doctor to show you pictures of noses similar to yours. (Jacob D. Steiger, MD, Boca Raton Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Natural looking rhinoplasty is a must</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2358" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5c2b43db30d37388c501e254aa351542">

</div><p>Every rhinoplasty when done properly will look natural. That’s right, I said every rhinoplasty! If you can tell that someone had their nose operated on, they had a poor result or poor surgeon. I sometimes bet my patients that their own parents will not know what they have done if they are seen three weeks after the operation. The parent or best friend will know that something is different, usually attributing the change to a different hairdo, weight loss, etc. In more than 30 years, I have never lost the bet! (Howard T. Bellin, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Natural Looking Rhinoplasty results are possible</h3><p>The best way to ensure that your rhinoplasty result will be natural when removing a nasal bump is to not over reduce the bridge so that it does not look like a ski slope. Using digital morphing during consultation can set the goal for surgery so that your plastic surgeon does not over do it.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2359" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Ideally in a man the bridge should be straight and in a woman a slight concave bridge looks feminine and not “done.” (Andrew Jacono, MD, Great Neck Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><ol>
<li>The results of rhinoplasty vary widely. It’s all about the surgeon’s skill and artistry.</li>
<li>Get 2 or 3 consultations, and ask to see a lot of before and after pictures. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Avoid the operated look in Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Looking natural is paramount in rhinoplasty surgery, and I agree this can not be overemphasized. As surgeons, we must make the nose look better in accordance with the patient’s desires, try to make the nose breathe better, and make it look completely natural.</p><p>These are the basic tenets of any rhinoplasty surgeon, and you need to find one of us. How to do it, you ask? Look at lots of the surgeon’s before/after photos – there should be many to look at. You should see older individuals, younger individuals, males, females, and individuals of different ethnicities.</p><p>This is all indicative of a well-rounded rhinoplasty experience. And make sure all the results look natural. I would also suggest you ask the simple question “is rhinoplasty the largest part of your practice?” I would ask this of the receptionist before you schedule your appointment, and also ask the doctor himself.</p><p>Simple truth is that you want to go to a rhinoplasty specialist, not just a plastic surgeon that claims to specialize in everything. And finally, have the surgeon do a pre-surgical simulation of your photos to give you an idea of what he thinks your rhinoplasty whould look like.</p><p>If it looks funny to you, run (don’t walk) to another surgeon. Granted, these imaging programs aren’t perfect, but a photo simulation should give you at least an idea of whether your surgeon understands your basic aesthetic wishes. (Randolph Capone, MD, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choose your Rhinoplasty surgeon wisely</h3><p>The best way to get a natural result is to choose a surgeon who shares your aesthetic sense.</p><p>Make sure your surgeon is experienced in rhinoplasty. He/she should have many before and after photos to share with you. Make sure you like the results and they look natural.</p><p>Computer imaging is a helpful tool to communicate the result you want. While it can’t guarantee a result, at least it shows that you and your surgeon are “on the same page.” (Richard Rival, MD, FRCSC, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Knowledge of facial beauty is essential when looking for a surgeon</h3><p>You definitely want to go to a surgeon with an extensive knowledge of facial beauty. This knowledge allows a surgeon to formulate goals to achieve when doing this procedure.</p><p>Your nose should be balanced in your face. The nasal tip is the center of attention and should be an equal distance from the level of your iris to the the level of your lower lip. The width of the nasal bridge should be about an iris width and the base of your nose at the level of your nostril should be around 3 iris widths. The width of your nose at the level of your eyes should gradually increase to the width of the base. Knowing the goals is extremely important.</p><p>After this you need to carry out these goals and you need all the skills in the surgeon to be able to achieve this. Rhinoplasty is one of the most difficult surgeries for a plastic surgeon and you should definitely go to someone who specializes in this procedure. (Philip Young, MD, Bellevue Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A millimeter matters in rhinoplasty</h3><p>The key element for all of rhinoplasty is to chose your rhinoplasty surgeon wisely. Do your homework and make sure he or she does this procedure often. Rhinoplasty is the most difficult cosmetic operation that is performed in plastic surgery. It is a surgery of millimeters, as one or two millimeters off can be the difference between a good result and a bad result. Also, it is important for you to have a good understanding of your expectations and what your surgeon can deliver. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choose carefully by results – not marketing</h3><p>The only way to get a natural-looking result is by looking at many before-and-after results of surgery. Many surgeons write extensively and market with catch-phrases. The 6-12 months-after photos are the only way to tell if you and the doctor have the same interpretation of “natural-looking” results.</p><p>There should be no scoops, pinched-tips, pig-noses, etc. Furthermore, a surgeon who specializes in Revision Rhinoplasty and has a great deal of experience will be more likely to achieve a good result – you won’t be participating in the learning curve. My before-and-after photos demonstrate how subtle changes provide a natural appearance after rhinoplasty. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my mind, the goal of rhinoplasty is to provide a very natural aesthetic result, but still maintain excellent function ( good breathing). The best way for you to determine who to choose as a surgeon, is to ask around your community. If you know people that had rhinoplasty, and you like their result, then ask them who did it for them. Personal referrals from previous patients are always the best! (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Natural Appearing Nose Job Results</h3><p>To get good and natural appearing nose job (Rhinoplasty) results several things must come together: You must have specifically defined realistic goals that you can communicate to your surgeon, you must have reasonable expectations, your surgeon must be experienced and have an artistic eye and finally, there would hopefully be no complications (unwanted events which are not at either your or your surgeon’s control).  (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
