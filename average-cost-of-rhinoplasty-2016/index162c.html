<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The price of any procedure is a result of the fee for the actual surgery as well as the costs related to having anesthesia and an operating room. Some surgeons have their own operating rooms and can control the cost of the entire procedure.</p><p>Others use surgery centers and hospitals, and there is a small chance of having to pay more after the procedure if more time is needed in the operating room than expected.</p><p>The average cost for a rhinoplasty varies widely depending on location and the extent of surgery, but a rough estimate is $3,000 to $20,000.</p><p>I caution that you should not choose your surgeon on price alone. Rhinoplasty is a delicate procedure, and revision surgery is very difficult (and much more expensive). (Dana Goldberg, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Rhinoplasty prices vary geographically, as well from surgeon to surgeon. I’ve seen fees around the U.S. for a new nose as low as $3000 in rural areas to more than $30,000 in major markets. In the greater Baltimore, all-inclusive nose job fees are very similar to those for new breasts – about $7000.</p><p>Revision rhinoplasty fees are more, and $9-10k is not uncommon. (Randolph Capone, MD, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Costs</h3><p>The functional part of the surgery (septum, turbinates, and displaced nasal bones) may be covered by your health care insurance. The coverage may include the anesthesiologist and the facility with proper benefits.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_175" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The cosmetic portion of the surgery (tip definition, nasal length, nasal dorsal bump) are not covered by your health care insurance. Because of multiple issues and potential insurance compensation for functional surgery, it is difficult to specify a fee however, if there is no insurance coverage the total average cost for the professional, anesthesia, and facility fees may range from $4000 – $6000.</p><p>Insurance coverage would reduce some of the cost. Consult a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon with rhinoplasty experience. (George C.

</div><p>A primary non ethnic rhinoplasty can begin at 6500.00 and up. Ethnic and revision rhinoplasties will require more time and possibly an implant which will increase the average cost. Furthermore, to achieve the best result in rhinoplasty takes years of experience and therefore – a detailed evaluation pre-operatively is required.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_178" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b4ce11390ef852fc1df830de3566001b">

</div><p>Therefore, the exact figure can not be given without this detailed evaluation. (Thomas Trevisani, Sr., MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of surgery will be influenced by complexity of surgery, time in the operating room, materials required, state-of-art equipment, after care with the surgeon or nursing staff, as well as experience and personalization of the service you receive and by geographic location.</p><p>Medical tourism such as going abroad for surgery is not recommended as research has show that a high proportion of patients are dissatisfied with their surgery.</p><p>Rhinoplasty is a precise procedure and choosing someone with skills discussed above is generally more important that price alone.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_176" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Average cost of rhinoplasty</strong> consists of:</p><ul>
<li>Surgeon’s fee</li>
<li>Hospital or Facility fee</li>
<li>Anaesthesia fee</li>
<li>Cost of equipment, graft material etc (Usually factored into Hospital fee) (Julian De Silva, MD, London Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul><h3>Average cost of rhinoplasty, nose surgery</h3><p>All plastic surgery cost depends on work that is desired or needed. Can you breathe, is your nose crooked, do you like the tip? Do you need a septoplasty? What is different about the nose is that once “touched” it is never the same. Like sculpture, there is no such thing as a “little nose job”.</p><p>All the parts must fit to have the nose look right and breathe easily. Costs I would suggest: $5000-10,000 depending on complexity and location and expertise.Revisions could easily cost that much or even more, so getting it done right the first time is your “best deal”. (Jeffrey Ditesheim, MD, FACS, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Cost</h3><p>There are many factors that determine the average rhinoplasty cost. One is geographic location, another maybe the complexity of the surgery. Insurance may also be a factor if there are functional issues. Because of these factors average rhinoplasty cost in the US may vary from 4K to up to 25k with an average price of 6K. (Oleh Slupchynskyj, MD, FACS, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average rhinoplasty cost in Reno</h3><p>The cost of a rhinoplasty can vary significantly depending on what specific operation is performed. In my practice the cost runs anywhere from $5000 to $10,000 depending on how extensive the operation.</p><p>For example, alteration of the tip of the nose only will be less expensive than a rhinoplasty where the dorsal hump is reduced, tip re-shaped, nasal septum straightened and the airway opened up.</p><p>Rhinoplasty is one of the most complex operations that plastic surgeons perform and so while price is a concern for most people it is also important to look at the individual surgeon’s experience, board status, and qualifications. (Timothy Janiga, MD, FACS, Reno Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty fees</h3><p>Fees vary for rhinoplasty surgery. In Toronto Ontario Canada fees vary from surgeon to surgeon. Fees can be influenced by the experience of the surgeon and on the complexity of the case. Furthermore some cases may have a medical component covered by Ontario Health Plan.</p><p>In such cases the fee for the procedure may be less than if the procedure is purely cosmetic in nature. Finally if the procedure is carried out in a hospital it may be less than if performed in a private facility. In my practice we offer surgery in our own private facility as well as in public hospitals. Touch up procedures may or may not be charged by surgeons. (Philip Solomon, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average cost of Rhinoplasty Surgery</h3><p>Average rhinoplasty cost varies greatly across the United States and around the world. Rhinoplasty cost is always one of the first questions asked. However, rhinoplasty cost should be taken into consideration with many other factors when choosing your cosmetic nasal surgeon, such as training, board certification, patient reviews, before/after photographs, etc.</p><p>Rhinoplasty is not one surgery, but rather many potential procedures to improve both the function and appearance of the nose. The cost of rhinoplasty varies greatly, but it’s usually similar for plastic surgeons in your area.</p><p>For example, northern Virginia rhinoplasty may range from $2000 to $20,000. Nationwide average rhinoplasty cost is about $6000.</p><p><strong><em>Average rhinoplasty cost</em></strong> is depends on several factors, but largely dependent on the following:</p><ul>
<li>Region – New York rhinoplasty is more expensive than rural Midwest</li>
<li>Complexity – Full rhinoplasty treating many parts of the nose and requiring anesthesia is more expensive than simple procedures isolated to specific areas which may be performed with local anesthesia</li>
<li>Revision rhinoplasty – Revision surgery more expensive than primary surgery</li>
<li>Surgeon – Some plastic surgeons charge significantly more or less than their peers</li>
</ul><p>In addition, portions of rhinoplasty surgery may also be covered by your insurance provider. The majority of cosmetic surgery is elective, so insurance plans don’t usually cover it.</p><p>However, there are exceptions and some plastic surgeons participate in the major insurance plans. Remember, plastic surgery covers a broad area of medicine which includes both reconstructive procedures and cosmetic procedures. If your procedure is medically indicated, some portion of the cost may be covered.</p><p>For example, Maryland patients with nasal allergy symptoms or sinus problems may combine their sinus surgery with rhinoplasty. (Houtan Chaboki, MD, Washington DC Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The cost of (Rhinoplasty) Nose reshaping?</h3><p>The total cost for nose reshaping or Rhinoplasty depends on the extent of the procedure you and your board certified Plastic surgeon or Facial Plastic Surgeon decide is required to achieve your results.</p><p>Costs also depend on whether the procedure is being done in an office, surgicenter or hospital setting and whether it is performed under intravenous sedation (twilight) or general anesthesia. The costs in our area run from $5500.00-12.000. (Laurie Casas, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Price range varies from geografical location and complexity of a case. In Miami price ranges from 4000 to 8000 dollars. (Ricardo Castrellon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my practice, the cost of surgery depends on how much work needs to be done.</p><p>This dictates how much time your surgeon needs to spend in the operating room performing different maneuvers. My advice is to find a surgeon whose results you like and has good bedside manner.</p><p>Rhinoplasty is an investment for a lifetime. (Richard A. Zoumalan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Cost on average</h3><p>Depending on the city and the surgeons experience a rhinoplasty surgery should range between $5,000 – $12,000 (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average cost of rhinoplasty</h3><p>As any other cosmetic surgery, the cost of rhinoplasty depends mostly on what needs to be done. A consultation is most helpful in determining that cost which varies with different doctors. Checking a doctor’s work and reputation are most important and more expensive does not mean better doctor. (Raja Srour, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of a nose job / rhinoplasty</h3><p>Unlike some other procedures like a breast augmentation or a tummy tuck a nose job or rhinoplasty can vary a great deal in cost. Why you may ask.</p><p>Well there are some surgeons that do a super quick rhino where they make limited incisions remove a hump and maybe a little cartilage while someone else may open the nose, address breathing issues like your septum, reduce your profile and reshapen your tip cartilage, etc. These are both called nose jobs.</p><p>Even yet there are more complicated and sophisticated maneuvers that can/should be done in order to get a really amazing result that LASTS the test of time. Anywhere from 5-15K on average. Definitely you get what you pay for with rhinoplasty (Rady Rahban, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much does rhinoplasty cost on average?</h3><p>The cost of any surgical procedure will vary from one surgeon to another and rhinoplasty is no exception.</p><p>The cost will be based on surgeon fee, anaesthetic fee, and hospital fee, and these will all vary from surgeon to surgeon, as will the anaesthetic vary depending on the type of anaesthetic used and if it given by an anaesthetist, as well as if it is a general or local anaesthetic. The hospital fee, also know as the facility fee, will based on if the procedure is performed in office, or a day surgery, or a hospital with an overnight stay.</p><p>Before surgery all patients should have a cost estimate placed in front of them to help them decide which options and which surgeon they choose. This way patient know what to expect from the procedure as well as what all of the costs will be. My advice is a cost of procedure should include:</p><ol>
<li>Surgeon fee</li>
<li>Anaesthetic fee</li>
<li>Hospital fee/ facility fee</li>
</ol><p>Expect the price to vary and be higher for</p><ol>
<li>More experienced/qualified surgeons</li>
<li>General anaesthetic</li>
<li>Acrredited hospital</li>
<li>Overnight hospital stay</li>
</ol><p>In short you get what you pay for, be sure that what yuo think is going to happen is going to happen, and be sure there are no added extra costs All the best Jeremy Hunt (Jeremy Hunt, MBBS, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Nose Surgery (Rhinoplasty) in Ontario</h3><p>You would be wise to choose your surgeon for Nose Surgery based on experience, qualifications, and their results rather than price. Having said that, the typical rhinoplasty will range from $5,500 to $8,000 depending on how involved the procedure is and whether any component of the surgery is covered by provincial healthcare.</p><p>In the case of secondary surgery or surgery involving rib grafts or implants the cost may be higher. (Cory Goldberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average cost of Rhinoplasty Surgery</h3><p>The cost of your rhinoplasty depends on what the procedure will entail. I make a point not to quote specific prices until the evaluation as I want to avoid misrepresenting the cost of the procedure if the evaluation should turn up any new information.</p><p>During a consultation, I explain all options in depth which better serves us both. With better information, we can make better decisions for your procedure. (Carlo Honrado, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job costs Vary.</h3><p>In any field there is variation in price according to market factors. The same applies to cosmetic surgery and especially nose job. Highly sought after plastic surgeons for whatever reason, either because of their surgical skills or marketing skills are able to demand higher fees.</p><p>It is difficult for the public to tell which doctors are really worth paying more for. Websites such as RealSelf are providing a service in this regard, because the playing field is leveled and the feedback from actual patients and the discussion does give one a better opportunity to make a reasonable assessment.</p><p>The costs also do vary according to location. In my geographic area the fees for nose job including the facility and anesthesia are about $5000-$7000. Sometimes it may be worth traveling and staying in a hotel with a friend for a week to find the surgeon of your choice. (Rodney A. Green, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of nose job</h3><p>The fees for nose job vary depending on the complexity of the case. Nose job is the one of the most complex operations performed by plastic surgeons and with the increased complexity of the nose job comes the cost variation. A primary nose job will be less expensive than a revision nose job, and a septorhinoplasty to correct breathing difficulties will also be more costly. This in part is due to the increase in operating room time and subsequent increase OR and anesthesia fees.</p><p>The average surgeons fee for a primary nose job in the DC area is around $6500 to $8000, this does not include the operating room or anesthesia fees.</p><p>If you have a deviated septum with breathing difficulties your insurance may cover a portion of the procedure. Most importantly make sure your surgeons is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Board of Otolaryngology and performs rhinoplastys frequently. (Rondi Kathleen Walker, MD, Washington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cost the nose job varies as noted below depending on many factors that are beyond your control. They are: In any given locale the spectrum may be double from the least expensive nose job to the most expensive. Don’t be swayed by the cost, making it a basis for choosing a surgeon.</p><p>Just make sure that your surgeon is experienced and board certified. your geographical location: prices in the Midwest and other areas are certainly less than that in New York and Los Angeles the experience of your surgeon, and his seniority of your surgeon the complexity of the operation.</p><p>I.e. is this a primary nose job or a secondary nose job whether or not you may receive insurance reimbursement for the functional aspect of the correction of your nose.
