Surgeons in both of those specialties have the potential to be good rhinoplastic surgeons.</p><p>It is much more important to pick a surgeon that has significant experience and talent performing rhinoplasty.</p><p>As you probably have learned, nasal surgery is one of the more difficult surgical procedures to master.</p><p>It takes not only aesthetic eye, but also expertise to execute the required techniques to achieve the desired result, not only in form but also in function. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What Type of Surgeon Makes the Best Rhinoplasty Surgeon?</h3><p>A lot has been made in the past about what kind of training and board-certifications make for the best rhinoplasty surgeon. Rhinoplasty is a complex surgery that always involves both function and esthetics.</p><p>Even if function is perfect to begin with, one would hate to end up looking better but breathing worse!</p><p>Even the most experienced rhinoplasty surgeons say they continue learning more about the operation as they gain more and more experience.</p><p>You should pick the surgeon that is experienced in rhinoplasty, and not just experienced in plastic surgery. (Minas Constantinides, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty is a very specialized surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2066" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-ba102a33119689a43842b0af9a9f4c6b">

</div><p>Rhinoplasty is a very specialized type of facial plastic surgery. As a result, the best choice of surgeon is one who focuses on this type of procedure. He/She should have the ability to address form and function of the nose, since both of these areas should be considered in every nasal surgery.</p><p>The surgeon should also have an aesthetic sense that matches your own, so that you can communicate your goals and desires effectively. A skilled nasal surgeon should also have a sense of how the nose sits in aesthetically with the rest of the face. In addition, he/she should have the ability to address any other related concerns or issues. (Michael R. Macdonald, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty is performed by both plastic surgeons and facial plastic surgeons</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2067" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Cosmetic rhinoplasty is performed by many Plastic Surgeons as well as ENT/Facial Plastic Surgeons. However, not every surgeon in each specialty chooses to perform cosmetic rhinoplasty.</p><p>Rather than using the term ‘general’ plastic surgeon, I prefer Plastic Surgeon of the Face and Body. It is important to seek out a board certified surgeon who performs many rhinoplasty procedures.</p><p>If you choose to seek out a Plastic Surgeon, you can locate one in your area from ASAPS, ASPS, and The Rhinoplasty Society. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Use a plastic surgeon for plastic surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2065" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-69d878c2edf505f6450abc6b78aa38f5">

</div><p>Rhinoplasty is a popular and effective surgery to recontour the shape of your nose. Keep in mind that even small changes to your nose can create a dramatic change in your overall appearance. For this reason, it is essential that you work with a board-certified plastic surgeon who has a great deal of experience in rhinoplasty. Although every patient and every rhinoplasty is unique, be sure to review photographs of the surgeon to get an idea of the variety and level of their work.</p><p>When interviewing surgeons, the most important factors for a great outcome is the training of the surgeon, the level of experience of the surgeon, and if you are comfortable working with that surgeon. Spend time interviewing different surgeons but make sure that you are able to easily communicate with your surgeon to explain your concerns and what your goals are. In our practice, we find the use of digital photography and digital morphing software to be essential. We morph the photograph of every patient as this is an excellent education and communication tool that allows us to fully understand what the goals of the patient are and to show them what is realistically possible.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2064" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-05d5972330a5ce9da40cb071f12d1b9e">

</div><p>Be sure that he find a surgeon that can offer this important tool to you as well. (Pat Pazmino, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Trust Your Face to a Board Certified Facial Plastic Surgeon</h3><p>There are excellent Facial Plastic Surgeons and General Plastic Surgeons who perform rhinoplasty. There are also many General Plastic Surgeons and Facial Plastic Surgeons who are not that proficient at rhinoplasty. My advice is to seek out consultations with several different surgeons to get as many opinions as possible. Ask to see before and after pictures. If a surgeon only has a few to show, be wary. It is likely that he or she is not that good or does not do the surgery that often. Facial Plastic Surgeons spend as many years in training (6 years at minimum) as General Plastic Surgeons and focus that entire time on the face. I am biased, but would argue that the average Facial Plastic Surgeon is more adept than the average General Plastic Surgeon at rhinoplasty. (Gregory Pippin, MD, Metairie Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing A Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>Whether you choose a board certified Facial Plastic Surgeon or a Plastic Surgeon, make sure their practice truly focuses on rhinoplasty.</p><p>There are many plastic surgeons out there who include rhinoplasty as one of the many procedures they offer. Only a fraction of these plastic surgeons do rhinoplasty as a major focus.</p><p>This can translate into a huge difference in terms of consistent successful outcomes. Make sure you see a wide variety of their rhinoplasty patient photo examples.</p><p>As other surgeons have pointed out here, it is incredibly difficult to be an ‘expert’ in a wide number of plastic surgery procedures.</p><p>Dedicating a large part of one’s practice to a particular procedure means they have specialty training and experience in that one procedure.</p><p>It also implies they have achieved sufficient success to sustain their practice by doing that one procedure on a regular basis. (John M. Hilinski, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty done by a facial plastic surgeon or a general plastic surgeon</h3><p>See 3 boarded surgeons or more if necessary. You can find double boarded Plastic/ENT surgeons. Maybe those are the ones you should use or just do your research. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Selecting your Best Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>You want an experienced, well trained surgeon with expertise in rhinoplasty surgery, whether he/she is a board certified Facial Plastic Surgeon or a Plastic Surgeon. It is best if a significant portion of your surgeon’s practice is rhinoplasty surgey. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Who should do my nose surgery?</h3><p>Your nose should be done by a physician who specializes in nasal surgery. Be it a Facial Plastic Surgeon or a Plastic Surgeon, be ware of the famous “laundry list” of expertise. No one can be great at everything, period. Interview your doctor, see pictures of before and after and ask around town and on the Internet to get a feel for your surgeon. Big promoters are usually just that, promoters. Go to a doctor that has been recommended by other patients or friends and who has experienced your future doctors results. (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best Rhinoplasty Surgeon’s Expertise Is More Important</h3><p>Choosing a qualified rhinoplasty surgeon is the most important decision you can make when deciding to under go nasal surgery. First and foremost, choose an surgeon who specializes in rhinoplasty – regardless of whether they are a “Facial” Plastic Surgeon or a “Plastic Surgeon” and who has experience correcting both functional problems (such as a deviated septum) and cosmetic problems.</p><p>Most patients are suprised to learn that not all Facial Plastic Surgeons or Plastic Surgeons are actually trained to perform rhinoplasty. Many residency programs (of both specialties) provide little to no experience in rhinoplasty, while other programs provide a great deal of training. Regardless of which speciality your surgeon trained in, he or she should be Board Certified in either Otolaryngology (ENT) or Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. Not all “cosmetic surgeons” have undergone the rigorous training in accredited residency programs that allow them to become Board Certified in either of these two specialties.</p><p>Most patients are also suprised to learn that not all Facial Plastic Surgeons or Plastic Surgeons perform many rhinoplasties in their practice. Inquire about what percentage of your prospective surgeon’s practice is dedicated to rhinoplasty. There are a few surgeons from each camp (FPS and PS) that have dedicated their practice exclusively to rhinoplasty. (C. Spencer Cochran, MD, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Facial plastic surgeons vs. general plastic surgeon</h3><p>“General plastic surgeon” is almost a perjorative term used by doctors who are not certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. The training of a plastic surgeon takaes five or six years and involves many areas of expertise; but many plastic surgeon become “super specialists” in areas such as cosmetic surgery, hand surgery, burns, cranio-facial surgery, etc., especially in large metropolitan areas. I have performed over 10,000 cosmetic surgeries and do not consider myself a “generalilst,” but rather an expert. (Howard T. Bellin, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The surgeon who operates on your nose should have a significant portion of their practice dedicated to correcting nasal issues. Their are both facial plastic and plastic surgeons who fit this description so please do your research. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I think that either one can do it well or poorly. It really depends upon their experience and their artistic eye. The best way to find the right one for you is to talk to friends that have had good results, and good experiences. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A facial plastic surgeon’s knowledge and skill comes from exclusively treating medical and surgical conditions pertaining to ears, nose and throat (ENT) prior to facial cosmetic surgery training.</p><p>This extensive background in ENT equips a facial plastic surgeon to address any breathing, reconstructive or cosmetic issues regarding the nose. Dr. Portuese has performed thousands of successful nasal surgeries including cosmetic, reconstructive, sinus related, breathing issues or a broken nose. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Rhinoplasty surgeons near me, you can find in section of our website.</p><h3>Rhinoplasty should be done by a specialist</h3><p>Both specialties (Facial Plastic Surgeons and Plastic Surgeons) are qualified to do Rhinoplasty. You want to make sure your surgeon is Board certified in either and that they have a good reputation for doing rhinoplasty. Don’t go to a doc for rhinoplasty just because they are good at liposuction. (Jason B. Diamond, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Board certified plastic surgeon for rhinoplasty</h3><p>You should not select a surgeon near you because they are a plastic surgeon or facial plastic surgeon. There are both plastic surgeons and facial plastic surgeons who are good at rhinoplasty. In my opinion one specialty does not have an advantage over the other. The most important factor is the individual surgeon’s skills. Rhinoplasty is different from most other types of surgery. The best rhinoplasty surgeons are artists – they are capable of combining the logic and step by step left brain thinking required with most surgeries with the artistic right brain skills required to create a beautiful nose. This point can not be underestimated. This is why you must look at before and after photographs on the surgeon’s website. During the consultation, make sure you look at fifty or more before and after photographs of patients operated on by the surgeon who you are considering. I also believe that you should research the surgeon’s credentials and Board Certification. While experience and the number of nasal procedures are important, as you will see when looking at before and after photographs, it does not always produce beautiful noses. (Daniel Reichner, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing a rhinoplasty specialist</h3><p>Facial plastic surgeons and plastic surgeons can both address your concerns with a rhinoplasty or revision.</p><p>I would recommend you find a good referral for either of these board certified surgeons. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Don’t get bogged down in names…look for a good rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>There are good and bad facial plastic surgeons and general plastic surgeons. Look for a board-certified rhinoplasty Surgeon.</p><p>Look for a rhinoplasty Surgeon who is willing to take time to talk to you, explain things to you, and performs a complete exam.</p><p>Ask to see before and after pics, and ask for references. If anything gives you the creeps, see someone else.</p><p>Get multiple opinions. Also make sure the office explains all of your financial options to you. (Raghu Athre, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Who should do my rhinoplasty?</h3><p>Both facial plastic surgeons can perform rhinoplasties. Most facial plastic surgeons perform rhinoplasties, while not all plastic surgeons do. Do your research, consults with several surgeons, and choose wth the one that you are comfortable with and has demonstrated to be proficient in rhinoplasty. (Andres Bustillo, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Surgeon</h3><p>See as many Rhinoplasty surgeons as you can or are comfortable with seeing, whether they are ENT or Plastic Surgery trained. Review their credentials (medical schools and training) as well as their experience (years in practice) and their areas of interest.</p><p>Form (aesthetics) and function are very important when it comes to rhinoplasty. Most rhinoplasty experts are keen to examine both aspects during your evaluation and will offer options accordingly. Finally, sit down with your surgeon(s) and review his/her surgical results and discuss your outcome desires. (John Philip Connors III, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A Board certifed surgeon who specializes in Rhinoplasty.</h3><p>In your quest for a <strong>rhinoplasty surgeon</strong>, you should seek out the local experts in your area.</p><p>Someone who is *board certified* in plastic surgery or facial plastic surgery, and who is a known specialist in surgery of the nose. We have started a rhinoplasty society in Maryland for individuals who are passionate about rhinoplasty called the John Orlando Roe Rhinoplasty Society (RoeSociety.org).</p><p>Individuals who are members of groups like this are likely to be very serious rhinoplasty surgeons, and are likely to be the type of surgeon you would want to go to. Check and see if there is a similar group in your area, and you will likely be close to finding your rhinoplasty Surgeon! (Randolph Capone, MD, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Who to choose for rhinoplasty surgery</h3><p>Either a board certified Facial Plastic Surgeon or Plastic Surgeon can be qualified to do rhinoplasty well. Not all have extensive experience with the procedure, however. Results can vary depending on a surgeon’s skill and experience. Bottom line is that you should pick your rhinoplasty Surgeon based on this and their prior results.</p><p>Some surgeons can have decades of experience with the surgery but may still have results that aren’t to your liking so definitely review before and after photographs of their patients.</p><p>Determine that the ‘after’ photographs represent long term results. One of the very challenging factors in rhinoplasty is obtaining and maintaining the aesthetic results for many years after it is done. Many noses can look great for the first few months after surgery only to reveal unwanted changes a year or more after surgery. (Thomas A. Lamperti, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Many surgical training programs prepare surgeons for rhinoplasty.</h3><p>Should my nose be done by a “Facial Plastic Surgeon” or a “General Plastic Surgeon:”. The answer is “yes”. The title is meaningless. The knowledge and experience in rhinoplasty is what is important and this should guide your decision. There are excellent rhinoplasty surgeons within both specialties. (Robert Mounsey, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Who should do your rhinoplasty</h3><p>Both plastic surgeons and otolaryngolgists are trained to do rhinoplasties. You should choose a board-certified surgeon who has experience in the procedure. View before and after photos of his patients and discuss your concerns and goals in detail. You might also speak to some previous patients. (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
