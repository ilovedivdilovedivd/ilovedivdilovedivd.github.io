<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Nose reshaping without surgery</h3><p>The alternatives to surgery are injectable fillers (i.e., Radiesse, Perlane, Juvederm), usually for the nasal bridge and tip.</p><p>These are temporary and last up to a year. Most patients that I do this for want to build up their bridge and don’t want a permanent implant like medpor or their own rib.</p><p>As a sculptor I know where to fill to make the nose look better; what I like about this technique is that it gives patients a preview of what their nose would like after rhinoplasty.</p><p>At least half the patients decide to go through with the surgery when they see their results. (Ramtin Kassir, MD, Wayne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to rhinoplasty</h3><p>If you do not like the appearance of your nose, a rhinoplasty is really the best solution. The so called “non surgical” rhinoplasties are risky. Skin slough (loss) has been reported. (Stuart H. Bentkover, MD, Boston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives To Surgical Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Depending on the type of nose you have and your desired goals, there are other alternatives to traditional surgical rhinoplasty for improving the appearance of one’s nose.</p><p>As mentioned in some of the other answers, the “non-surgical rhinoplasty” refers to using soft tissue fillers to alter the shape and contour of the nose. The non-surgical rhinoplasty is much less invasive and less expensive.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2233" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In the appropriate patient, one can achieve great results with fillers. However, certain nasal defects or problems will require traditional surgical rhinoplasty. I recommend you consult with a board-certified dermatologist, plastic surgeon, or ENT-facial plastic surgeon to learn about the best treatment options for your nose. (Channing R. Barnett, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h3>The Injectable Non-surgical Nosejob</h3><p>It is an unfortunate truism that it is difficult if not impossible to effect a change in the appearance of the nose without altering the underlying structure or the overlying skin. The only circumstance where small amounts of filler may be indicated is when a rhinoplasty has already been performed and minor cartilage or soft tissue contour deformities exist but are not severe enough for a formal revision.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2232" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Regardless, any filler injection will last only six months or so but will provide an idea of what may be achieved non-surgically. Even though filler alterations are by necessity minor, they should only be performed by an experienced Plastic Surgeon. (Paul S. Howard, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There are no good nose job alternatives</h3><p>While minor corrections can be made with filler injections, none of the materials are permanent and are therefore an ongoing expense. Not much can actually be achieved this way and of course injections will make some part of the nose bigger. I advise that a person have a rhinoplasty to achieve the result they want, or do nothing. (Howard T. Bellin, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non Surgical Rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2231" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-1718a8105512214d9486fd4f0a714a4e">

</div><p>While a rhinoplasty gives the doctor the greatest ability to make the most changes in nose shape with permanent results, there are some changes that can be made without surgery to the nasal shape. One is using Radiesse an injectable filler that lasts about a year to re-contour the nasal bridge. By filling the bridge above a nasal hump or bump the profile can be straightened. (Andrew Jacono, MD, Great Neck Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose Job Alternatives</h3><p>While there are no permanent alternatives to nose surgery (that I would recommend), there are many non-permanent approaches. Restylane, Perlane, Juvederm, AND Radiesse are great alternatives. I do not recommend silicone and/or Bio Polymer. THESE CAN CAUSE PERMANENT INJURY. (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonsurgical rhinoplasty with Radiesse</h3><p>I have had nice, reliable results using Radiesse. However, this technique is really only for contour depressions. I have used it for divots or depressions from previous trauma, surgery, and for people who didn’t like their supratip profile (the area just above the tip). It seems to last about a year before needing reinjection, or surgery, so it’s not a permanent solution. (Douglas J. Mackenzie, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty alternatives</h3><p>Simply stated there are no good lasting alternative to surgery to improve nasal deformities permanently.</p><p>You can use fillers with minor improvements, not long lasting and have to be repeated.</p><p>If you are not ready mentally for surgery then do not do the surgery. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non-surgical nose job</h3><p>The nonsurgical nose job is a very safe and effective treatment for very specific types of nasal deformities.</p><p>The tip of the nose can be lifted with an Injectables and certain types of bumps can be camouflaged as well.</p><p>This alternative is fairly inexpensive but the results are temporary. (Jason B. Diamond, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non Surgical Nose Job</h3><p>There are many injectable products that can be used instead of a surgical nasal revision. For many patients that just need some contour change, use of hyaluronic acid such as Perlane or Juvederm or a calcium hydroxyapatitie product such as Radiesse offers a great alternative.</p><p>If the nose is deviated to the point that air flow is restricted, surgery is the best option because injections can only alter the appearance but not the structure. (Kenneth Beer, MD, Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonsurgical Nose Jobs – The Alternative to Nose Job Surgery</h3><p>Lots of surface nasal deformities can be treated these days without surgery in a matter of only five or ten minutes.</p><p>These include humps, bumps and “ski slope” deformites along the bridge of the nose or at the tip of the nose, saddle deformities, in which the top of the nose is sunken, surface irregularities left by prior surgical nose jobs, and even droopy nasal tips resulting from age-related cartilage loss at the tip of the nose or a family predisposition.</p><p>Although permanent fillers would seem like they should be the ideal answer, I advise against their use. Once implanted they cannot be removed.</p><p>Any lumps and bumps that may occur can become permanent and difficult or impossible to treat. And lastly, as bone and cartilage are naturally lost with age, a result that looks terrific today may appear bizarre five to ten years down the road.</p><p>Radiesse, on the other hand, composed of calcium hydroxylapatite, a bone-like substance, is my personal favorite for volumizing and recontouring the nose.</p><p>Since there is typically little movement in nasal regions to contribute to early breakdown of the injected material, the results can be expected to last between 18 and 24 months, after which a touch-up will be needed.</p><p>Most patients are highly gratified by the rapid and often dramatic results obtained in only minutes by this technique. There is little or no downtime, so most people return to work or social activities immediately, making this a true, nonsurgical lunchtime beauty fix. (Nelson Lee Novick, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Fillers for Rhinoplasty</h3><p>There are alternatives, but it depends on what you want to achieve. Fillers can be used, especially Radiesse which is temporary but will last between 12 to 18 months. (Bruce E. Katz, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non surgical nose job</h3><p>These procedures are minimally invasive and can achieve great results. Not all nose issues can be addressed with fillers so you need your doctor to advise you on this after seeing you in person. Although these procedures are not “permanent” like surgery, it is quick, can last a year or more and has little to no downtime.</p><p>Please be sure someone highly trained in injections is doing your work and they can help you choose if this is your best option. (Shawn Allen, MD, Boulder Dermatologist)</p><h3>You should consult a specialist experienced in the art of Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty.</h3><p>If your nose isn’t too large, you would be surprised how an Injectable Filler treatment can improve the appearance of your nose.</p><p>Feel free to email a frontal and profile photo, and I’ll be happy to share my thoughts regarding Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty. (Eric M. Joseph, MD, West Orange Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although injectables can adjust contour, a properly performed rhinoplasty is the proper way to generate and attractive nose that fits the face. The specifics can be discussed with a surgeon who does this operation often. The anticipated results can be aided by computer imaging which I use on all patients. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to a Nose Job</h3><p>Although minor changes can be made with fillers, the best alternative if you don’t want a ” nose job” is to do nothing. Why invest the time and money to achieve a very subtle change in your nose?</p><p>Having said that, I recommend getting a consultation to clarify your personal alternatives. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non surgical rhinoplasty</h3><p>If you are looking to change the appearance of your nose, I would recommend speaking with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon about what changes can be made without surgery.</p><p>Typically, you can correct minimal deformities of the bridge with camoflauge by injecting a filler to make the bridge look straight, and sometimes raise the tip up a bit in the same fashion, but to reduce the nose would not be possible with injections. Your individual nose should be evaluated to determine what, if anything, can be done to change your nose without having surgery. (Amy T. Bandy, DO, FACS, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The Filler Rhinoplasty</h3><p>A non surgical rhinoplasty has made its way through the media circles. This involves the use of fillers, such as Radiesse or Juvederm, to augment the nose, typically along the bridge. This is done to camouflage a ‘bump’. Filler can be placed above and below the bump to straighted the appearance of the nasal bridge.</p><p>This is a temporary fix, and one prominent rhinoplastic surgeon has reported on having to surgically remove these ‘temporary’ fillers. Fillers can also be used in post rhinoplasty patients where a small amount of augmentation is necessary. Injecting small amounts of silicone have been described to permanently augment small areas after rhinoplasty.</p><p>Overall I would not recommend fillers to most patients as an alternative to rhinoplasty. They can not make a tip more refined, can not make broad nasal bones look thinner, and need to be repeated. A well done rhinoplasty should give the patient a life long result that will be far less costly than a lifetime of filler. (Scott M. Gayner, MD, Harrisburg Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives for nasal surgery</h3><p>Injectable fillers (Restylane, Juvaderm, Perlane, etc.) have been used to try to enhance the appearance of the nose but there are two big problems. (1) The fillers are not permanent so the nose has to be re-injected approximately every 6-9 months, and (2) the fillers can only be used to build up certain areas of the nose which will increase the size of the areas which most patients do not want or need. (Jack P. Gunter, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>
