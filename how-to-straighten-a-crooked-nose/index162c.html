Seel evaluation by an experienced surgeon to learn about your options. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Developmental Linear Nasal Deviations and their Correction</h3><p>To fully answer your question requires a dissertation, of sorts. Correction of deviated noses is potentially the hardest facial cosmetic surgery of them all. I have written several medical papers on the subject in which patient anatomy is analyzed and certain surgical techniques are explored. Every deviated nasal case is unique, in my experience. I developed a technique, called foundation rhinoplasty to help deal with nasal deviations. It involves several key grafts and maneuvers to help address the issues at hand.</p><p>There are many factors at play: The external nose itself having asymmetric structures on the right and left sides, the septum (both bony and cartilaginous) being deviated, and likely an underlying facial asymmetry, which creates problems with the foundation of the nose itself.</p><p>Some areas can be corrected, while others require camouflage techniques. Most often, a deviated nose can be corrected to a point close to straight, but not exactly straight. For most patients, this is more than enough from both a functional and cosmetic standpoint. Make sure you seek information from a surgeon that specializes in nasal airway AND deviated nose Rhinoplasty.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2493" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Make sure they show you the frontal and base views from previous patients, not just profiles and 3/4 views. All in all, your deviation is not that significant and should be correctable with a resonable degree of predictability. (Richard W. Westreich, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correcting the crooked nose is one of the more difficult rhinoplasties to perform</h3><p>Correcting the crooked nose is one of the more difficult rhinoplasties to perform and you should in my opinion seek out a facial plastic surgeon or a plastic surgeon who is familiar with the anatomy of the inside of the nose as well as the outside of the nose. A congenitally crooked nose is almost always the result of a highly deviated septum. There is an expression in rhinoplasty surgery “so goes the septum so goes the nose.”</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2494" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In order to properly fix your crooked nose as well as address any other concerns you might have with your nose such as a hump or tip width, the surgeon must address the high septum during the surgery. Without fixing that portion of the inside of your nose, you nose will bend back again if this is not addressed during your surgery. A lot of surgeons can do the outside of the nose but do not have experience fixing high deviations of the septum which is likely the cause in your case. Anyway, your observation of your nose is quite astute as most patients don’t realize their nose is crooked and just think that it is too wide on one side. Yours is clearly crooked. (Scott Trimas, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked nose</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2495" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b527d53b3c9f8347f60fc0f1d1176e70">

</div><p>You should see a rhinoplasty expert and be evaluated. Please understand that the crookedness comes from the deeper structures of the nose and facial bony structures and it is alomst never possible to get it perfectly straight. Go for improvement, not perfection in a crooked nose. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked Nose treatment</h3><p>There are options for correction of your crooked nose, none of them without surgery. You should see a board certified plastic or facial plastic surgeon and let him/her examine your nose to determine the anatomic cause. Only then can they make a decision as what procedure needs to be done to correct it. Be sure to ask about the potential risks and complications, the surgeon’s experience, ask to see pictures of patients they have done or even talk with patients that have had the procedure. You need to feel confident that your surgeon can accomplish your goals and expectations. If concerned, get a second opinion. (Theodore Katz, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Fixing crooked nose</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2496" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your nose is deviated but I doubt it is because of any genetic influence. The nasal bones are VERY small and do not by themselves cause a deviation. The deviation is caused by both a tilting and rotation of the Vertical plate of the Sphenoid (the bony septum), the cartilaginous septum, anomalies of the Vomer (the bone supporting the septum at the floor of the nose – OR a combination of all three elements.</p><p>Correction of the deviation would depend on WHICH of the above is involved. In general the deviated portion is either removed (SMR , Sub mucous resection), weakened on the bulging side so it springs back the other way, OR the attachment to the floor of the nose is undone, the septum is swung back to the mideline and if needed held in the midline with special jig cartilage (SPREADER) grafts. There are No non-surgical treatments for a septal deviation. Good Luck. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Straightening the crooked nose</h3><p>To straighten the crooked nose usually involves dealing with multiple components, including the nasal bones and the septum.</p><p>I would appraoch this with an open septo-rhinoplasty with straightening of the bones with nasal osteotomies and a septoplasty with possible internal cartilage grafts.</p><p>Very common problem and if you have not had a previous rhinoplasty or significant trauma it should be correctable.  (Andrew P. Trussler, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Straightening the Crooked Nose with Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Facial asymmetry is normal, and no one has a perfectly symmetric face. Rhinoplasty may be improve nasal asymmetry, but is one the greatest challenges in facial plastic surgery.</p><p>Crooked or twisted noses may be from trauma, prior nasal surgery, or congenital. As others have already mentioned, rhinoplasty surgery may result in a better nose, but not perfectly straight.</p><p>Deviated noses are commonly associated with deviated septums. Only after a comprehensive evaluation will a rhinoplasty surgeon be able to determine the best option for you. (Houtan Chaboki, MD, Washington DC Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>See an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon.</h3><p>Your nose and septum can be straightened with surgery. The result will usually be a straighter nose, but not always perfect.</p><p>See an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon and discuss all of the other changes you would like as well. Make sure he does the kind of nose you like as well. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Straightening a crooked nose can be challenging</h3><p>It is possible to straighten a crooked nose using rhinoplasty techniques. A congenitally crooked nose often needs to have all three components straightened The nasal bony bridge The nasal cartilagenous bridge (mid part of nose) The tip cartilage. Your nose appears to have all three components that require straightening. In addition, there is often a deviated septum which needs to be corrected. Select surgeon who is skilled in both correcting the outer part of the nose and knows how to correct a deviated septum. (Ran Y. Rubinstein, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nasal asymmetry</h3><p>Nasal asymmetry is normal . No one nose is perfectly straight. If you have significant crookedness, the nose can be straightened to make it better but not perfect. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked Nose and Radiesse</h3><p>A crooked nose can be fixed by rhinoplasty. It can sometimes be alo improved by adding Radiesse filler in to the depressed area. For e.g., in your case adding a filler like Radiesse to the left side of the nose will increase the bulk on that side and then both sides will look the same and give the illusion of a straight nose. However, the best option is to reset the crooked bones and any cartilage that might be crooked. Regards (Tanveer Janjua, MD, Bedminster Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty can straighten the appearance of your nose.</h3><p>Your photo certainly shows a concavity on the left side of your nose. If that’s all that bothers you, then Injrctable Fillers could be used to improve your appearance. I’ve attached a link to a photo demonstrating this technique. (Eric M. Joseph, MD, West Orange Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crooked noses are common but rarely hereditary</h3><p>It is most likely a coincidence that both a mother and a son have the same deviation of the nose. The most common causes for a crooked nose is some sort of trauma during the developing phases of the nose. This may have occurred during birth or by falling and hitting your nose during early nasal growth as a child. A condition called hemi-facial atrophy can also be associated with a crooked nose and may have a hereditary component, but from the photo I can tell you don’t have that rare condition.</p><p>As for treatment, Straightening a nose can be challenging, but a qualified rhinoplasty surgeon can usually make a nose much straighter.
