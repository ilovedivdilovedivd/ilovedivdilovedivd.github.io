Better may mean a more symmetric nose or a more defined nose or one with a higher bridge or a more projected tip, etc.</p><p>But in all these cases the nose is actually “larger” since more has been added and nothing has been removed. In patients who are ideal candidates for a non surgical rhinoplasty this addition and “enlargement” is actually beneficial and makes the nose look so much better overall.</p><p>In your case its impossible to determine what is best for you based on this single picture you posted but from the look of this picture you could add a little bit of Restylane non-surgically above your bump or ideally take down the bump surgically.</p><p>Also from your picture it looks like addition of a chin implant would balance your face and actually make your nose look smaller. But I would need to see more photos and examine you for a more precise analysis and diagnosis. (Shervin Naderi, MD, FACS, )</p><h3>Distract the eye away from the nose with fillers elsewhere</h3><p>I looked at your photo, and really, your nose doesn’t appear that big. It just seems out of proportion to your other features.</p><p>If you build up the jaw line and create a sharper angle at the corner of the jaw, all of your features will be more balanced. Sometimes I also build up the cheeks to, to also make a prominent nose appear smaller.</p><p>Hard to tell from the one photo if you would benefit from that or not.

</div><p>Fillers (injectable nosejobs) can be used to change the shape of the nose, but it is only appropriate for certain people. As you can imagine, since you are injecting a filler INTO the nose, this can’t really make the nose smaller. Sometimes a filler can help the nose look a little smaller by making the nose and face appear more balanced, but this isn’t often the case.</p><p>The only way to truly reduce the size of a nose is with a rhinoplasty (nose reshaping operation). I would certainly encourage you to seek consultation with a local surgeon who is well versed in rhinoplasty. A dermatologist or practitioner who doesn’t do rhinoplasty might even suggest a liquid nose job (if you’ve only got a hammer, everything looks like a nail).

</div><p>Unfortunately, there is no treatment to make a nose smaller that is non surgical. There are a variety of injectables and tissue gratfs that are used to correct a complication following rhinoplasty. These are used to improve irregularities and size issue after surgery. (Thomas A. Narsete, MD, Greenwood Village Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non-surgical nose job to make nose smaller</h3><p>While certain characteristics can be altered to create a more harmonious nose, no non-operative technique can make it actually smaller. Fillers to fix the depression at the root of the nose (radix) can create the appearance of a straight nose, and make a hump less noticeable. Filler in the columella and tip can plump up a droopy tip, make the nasal tip lifted, perky, and even a little more pointy. This can create the appearance of a more proportionate nose, but cannot make it appear smaller. However, fillers in the cheek or chin can augment and balance the facial proportions, and thus make the nose appear smaller, because the surrounding structures are made more balanced with the nose. (Navin K. Singh, MD, )</p><h3>Non-Surgical Nasal Reduction</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1894" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The non surgical nose job can help with many aesthetic issues. In general, a filler such as a hyaluronic acid (Restylane, Juvederm, Prevelle, etc.) or a more long lasting filler such as Radiesse or Artefill is used to augment the injected area. The filler hides and smoothes contour irregularities or adds to the size of other areas. Together, these contour changes will change the overall appearance of a nose.</p><p>So, how can this help to make a nose look smaller? If your nose had a dorsal hump (hump on the bridge of your nose) or hooked appearance, filling above the hump could make the nose look smaller. By filling above the hump, the hump itself appears less prominent and thus the nose itself looks less prominent. Our eyes are naturally drawn to changes in contour. So, by reducing the severity of the change in contour from the forehead to the nose, i.e. by making the hump less of hump, a non-surgical nose job would make the hump appear to be less noticeable.</p><p>The nose itself would not be smaller. In fact, the nose would be in overall volume larger. But it would appear smaller. Unfortunately, given your picture, I don’t think the non-surgical nose job would be a good option for you. This is advice based only on your photo though and is not a substitute for an in depth exam and consultation with an expert in your area. (Edward S. Lee, MD, Englewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><center><div class="clearfix" id="gallery-1">

</div></center><h3>Nonsurgical Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Nonsurgical Rhinoplasty cannot make a nose smaller but it can give the illusion of a smaller nose.</p><p>Based on your side profile, I would recommend chin augmentation to better balance your nose and help it look smaller as the chin projects further.</p><p>Also, making the angle of the nose with the forehead deeper can make the nose smaller. Because your forehead slopes backwards, this also gives the illusion of a bigger nose. You can consider, though I can’t tell from the side profile, of adding a small amount of filler between the eyebrows to make the nose smaller though this may not fit your sloping forehead.</p><p>Balancing other features on your face such as your cheeks or your jawline can also take the attention away from your nose though it really isn’t that big.</p><p>Chin augmentation can be performed in the office with volumizers such as sculptra or Radiesse and, if you want to avoid surgery, this is the route I would take. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non-surgical rhinoplasty works by adding above and below a nasal hump to make it less obvious</h3><p>Non-surgical rhinoplasty sounds great, but noses, tips and bumps cannot be made smaller without surgery. The way that non-surgical rhinoplasty works is that filler, usually hyaluronic acid such as Restylane or Juvederm, is injected above and sometimes below a hump on the nose to make it less obvious.</p><p>This actually makes the nose larger. If the tip of your nose pulls down when you smile, using Botox under the nose to weaken the muscle that pulls the tip down (called the depressor nasi muscle) can help reduce that pulling as well. But if you really want/need a smaller nose, surgery is necessary. (Steven J. Pearlman, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non-surgical Rhinoplasty to Reduce Nose Size – not yet</h3><p>Unfortunately there are no ways to reduce the size of a nose with non-surgical rhinoplasty (aka filler or injectable rhinoplasty). Non-surgical rhinoplasty is best for patients who need augmentation or more volume in certain areas. In a few cases, fillers can improve the proportions in a large nose (e.g. a patient with a small hump but a very deep radix), but overall, surgery is still best for nasal shapes like yours. (Michael M. Kim, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Only surgery can make a nose smaller</h3><p>No, there is no non-surgical rhinoplasty procedure that can make your nose smaller. By its very nature, injecting something into the nose must make it larger. See the Web reference link for a computer simulation of changes to your nose: bringing the tip back closer to your face and taking down the gentle hump along the bridge. Some doctors feel they can make a nose appear smaller with injections – for example, disguising a hump by injecting above and below the hump. But in my opinion, it only makes the nose look bulkier, and therefore larger. Sometimes surgery is the only option! (Steven M. Denenberg, MD, Omaha Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Can my nose be smaller</h3><p>Some issues just require surgery, and this is one of them. There is no non-surgical way to make a nose smaller. I have attached a link that might interest you. (Stuart H. Bentkover, MD, Boston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonsurgical Rhinoplasty to Reduce Nose Size</h3><p>Non-surgical rhinoplasty is usually carried out using fillers to add size or volume to various parts of the nose. By definition, it can not reduce the size of the nose. Based on your profile photo, you would do well with surgical rhinoplasty and should discuss chin augmentation also. Speak to a board-certified plastic surgeon who is experienced performing rhinoplasty to review your options.  (Parham Ganchi, PhD, MD, Wayne Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonsurgical procedures to reduce the size of the nose</h3><p>While there are no nonsurgical procedures that will truly reduce the size of your nose, you do have a relatively soft chin. In general, when the chin is underdeveloped, the nose appears even bigger.</p><p>A long-lasting injectable filler such as Juvéderm or Perlane (Laxmeesh Mike Nayak, MD, Saint Louis Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non surgical reduction rhinoplasty</h3><p>Non surgical rhinoplasty uses injectable fillers to camouflage bumps or correct asymmetries. It is not an effective technique for reduction rhinoplasty.</p><p>The only means of achieving a natural, appropriately sized nose in your situation is through surgery. (Robert Glasgold, MD, East Brunswick Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Make my big nose smaller without surgery</h3><p>Unfortunately, I don’t see how to make your nose smaller without surgery. Based on these limited views, it is not a bad nose to begin with!</p><p>I don’t appreciate a dorsal hump, good tip structure, appropriate tip rotation. Your Chin is slightly recessed, something to consider. The dorsum could be lowered slightly and a slight supratip break could be achieved with minimal efforts.</p><p>Consult a rhinoplasty surgeon with considerable experience in finesse rhinoplasty if you elect to go forward. (Arthur N. Falk, MD, Albany Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonsurgical nose job procedure to reduce nose size</h3><p>A <a href="../../non-surgical-nose-job/index.html" target="_blank">nonsurgical nose job</a> involves placing temporary injectables into the nose to build up a depression In the nose. A nonsurgical nose job ads volume to the nose, and makes the nose bigger, not smaller. To reduce the nose size, a surgical rhinoplasty is required. Virtual rhinoplasty software is available on the website below along with our surgical rhinoplasty photo gallery. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Chin implant is sometimes the best option for facial harmony</h3><p>You have a strong nose and a handsome face, but your chin is relatively weak in relation to your lips and other facial features. An option to consider, rather than rhinoplasty, is a small chin implant to improve the projection of your chin and jaw line.</p><p>Nasal reduction surgery can alter the support of nose and produce undesirable long term results when not performed with perfect technique. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nasal Reduction</h3><p>Unfortunately, nasal reduction cannot be accomplished without surgical intervention. Nonsurgical rhinoplasty utilizes injectable fillers to correct nasal contour irregularities. Your particular deformity will require surgical rhinoplasty and consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non-surgical rhinoplasty and size</h3><p>Non-surgical rhinoplasty is about addition of material to your nose, usually a facial filler. By adding filler, rhinoplasty can help make the nose look straighter or more symmetric.</p><p>It is not a reductive procedure so it can not make a nose physically smaller. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Injectable Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Usually, reshaping the nose with any injectable product is about enlarging and rebuilding areas. This is most useful for patients who have flattened areas such as a flat bridge. Unfortunately, trying to make the nose smaller such as removing a hump on the top of the nose is not possible. While sometimes this can be camouflaged to some extent, this is limited and your expectations from a procedure like that need to be realistic. (Cory Goldberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non-surgical Nose Job Procedures</h3><p>In general, non-surgical nose jobs can only fix issues with straightening or volume for the nose. It will most likely not be able to give you a smaller nose. I would recommend seeing a couple of facial plastic surgeons to provide you with different options. (Carlo Honrado, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non Surgical Nose Job Can Not Downsize a Nose</h3><p>A non-surgical nosejob is the use of a filler to reshape the nose. Because the filler is adding material to the nose, it inherently can not make the nose smaller. (Richard A. Zoumalan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
