(Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Age for nose job in females</h3><p>While technically, many young women at 16 can qualify for nose job, I like to wait until the patient is 18.</p><p>The reasons are to make sure the patient is fully aware of what they are doing and to ensure the face has matured enough.</p><p>I will make exceptions in patients with significant breathing issues, nasal trauma, or a very disfiguring nose. Wait another year or two, then get your nose job. (A. John Vartanian, MD, Glendale Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job in 16 year old female is appropriate, with parental approval.</h3><p>If you have reached full adult growth and have not shown signs of any further growth, age 16 or even earlier is physiologically appropriate for nose job surgery.</p><p>Since you are a minor, you will need parental consent in order to proceed with surgery, and most surgeons will also assess your maturity and ability to independently understand risks, complications, recommendations, and provide your own informed consent (regardless of your parental approval and/or payment).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3518" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-39f8cba1dc7f4320b132af535d68c872">

</div><p>I believe it is also critical to assess the motivation for requesting nose job surgery (assuming it is not for correction of a traumatic deformity, such as a softball injury) for cosmetic reasons: is this something the patient has been bothered with for some time, or is this the result of an offhand comment by a boyfriend or a “mean girl” at school? Is the cosmetic concern real or is it mostly imagined? Does the prospective patient have realistic expectations and the maturity to deal with “less-than-perfect” results or complications?</p><p>My own daughter requested nose job from the time she was age 12, and one look at my photo will tell you that this was based on her having dad’s too-large bulbous nose on her own cute female face. She was 15 years old (had not grown for a year) when I performed nose job for her, and she has been happy with her nose ever since. For the right patient, this can be a wonderful procedure that can boost self-esteem and an innate sense of well-being. (Richard H. Tholen, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Teenage nose job</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3519" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-ec3ee9ea3da410c5b0549d34aea65783">

</div><p>In girls, facial features mature at a younger age than in boys. Most of the time, it is acceptable to have rhinoplasty at sixteen if you are female. For males, I prefer to wait until age eighteen, unless it is to correct an injury. Be sure to involve at least one of your parents in this important decision if you are under eighteen. (James Bartels, MD, Manchester Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Can a rhinoplasty be performed in a 16 year old girl?</h3><p>The nose is usually fully grown in most girls by age 16 so performing a rhinoplasty is acceptable. However, in addition to financial considerations, you would need approval from your parent(s) to have a rhinoplasty performed as you are still a minor. (Steven Turkeltaub, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job At Age 16 Can Be Satisfactorily Done</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3520" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-195da8fb3d7204625cf049dc2e131a8d">

</div><p>With parental consent, one can have a nose job at age 16. The nose is developed enough to permit a complete rhinoplasty, if needed, to be performed. (Barry L. Eppley, MD, DMD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Age for nose job</h3><p>I do girls as young as 14 if they have full maturity of the nose. In males I prefer to wait tip 18, but there are exceptions if the nose growth seems complete or there has been a fracture. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job is Possible At 16</h3><p>In general, it is possible to have a nose job as a 16 year old male or female. At this age the nose has fully developed in the majority of people.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3521" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-368574394015f1392e64ad20b94a896c">

</div><p>Nose job surgery can lead to a permanent improvement in your nose and overall appearance. You should be evaluated by a facial plastic surgeon or plastic surgeon that performs a significant amount of nose job.</p><p>Be sure to see before and after photos of their patients and make an informed decision. (Jacob D. Steiger, MD, Boca Raton Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When is the right time to do nose job.</h3><p>Usually by age 16, one’s nasal structures have matured and little or no further growth is expected. This is the usual cut off age for nose job but it depends on the patient’s structural maturity. Occasional very mature patients, younger than this age, have had successful nose job. (Mohsen Tavoussi, MD, DO, Newport Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What is the right age to get a nose job?</h3><p>Age 18 to 20 comprise of many of my rhinoplasty patients. In General, I recommend that female patients to be at least 16 and male patients to be at least 18 before considering a rhinoplasty procedure.</p><p>You have reached the age of ‘consent’ and can have any cosmetic procedures, but remember someone has to pay for it. Make sure your parents are involved with the process. Have a consult with a surgeon who specializes in rhinoplasty. (Kevin Sadati, DO, Orange County Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Rhinoplasty can be performed at 18 years of age for the vast majority of patients (even earlier if necessary), assuming they have realistic expectations and goals. (Anurag Agarwal, MD, Naples Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>You may legally get a nosejob at 18.</h3><p>The patient must be legally of age to sign for a rhinoplasty, which is 18. This does not mean that the operation is the best thing to do.</p><p>There are psychological considerations as well as the usual surgical. Are there friends and family who think you shouldn’t? Why is that? What does your surgeon think? Whatever, don’t rush into it. If you’re not sure, don’t do it. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Is 18 too young for a nose job?</h3><p>The short answer is no. There has been a strongly held and long standing belief Septorhinoplasty shouldn’t be done until a certain age.</p><p>The given explanation is the nose is immature and hasn’t finished growing and therefore there is a risk of stunting its growth. The real answer is its not the physical maturity but the emotional mature that is the deciding factor. Dr Crysdale in Toronto has advocated for many years and has produced impressive results showing chronological age isn’t the issue, rather the ability to manage the post operative recovery. (Oakley Smith, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty at age 18 is your decision</h3><p>For both men and women 18 is a fine age for rhinoplasty, even as early as age 16. At 18, you have reached the age of ‘consent’ and can have rhinoplasty without anyone else making the decision. If you understand the procedure and risks well, and you and your surgeon understand what you would like you should be ready for rhinoplasty. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>18 is the Age of Consent</h3><p>At age 18, an individual has reached the age of consent (barring any physiologic or psychiatric issues which would compromise judgment). In addition, the septum and mid-face have reached adult size. Therefore, the decision to have Rhinoplasty or not is based on your specific concerns and whether the Surgeon agrees that appropriate changes can be made to reach your goals. (Stephen Prendiville, MD, Fort Myers Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty – Age not main issue</h3><p>I believe that age is not the major issue when it comes to most cosmetic procedures. I believe that with rhinoplasty, in particular, level of maturity and ability to outline the areas of concern are much more important. It is extremely important that you can communicate your desires effectively so the surgeon can determine if those concerns are realistic and correctable.</p><p>Yes, you can proceed with rhinoplasty at age 18, and even sooner, with parental consent and emotional support. (James M. Kurley, MD, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose Job at Age 18</h3><p>No problem see a local boarded surgeon in MIAMI. Recommend seeing Dr Carlos Wolfe, Dr Claude Noriega, Dr A. Bustillo. Oh I’m also from MIAMI (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Age of rhinoplasty</h3><p>It is perfectly acceptable to have a rhinoplasty at the age of 18. As a general guideline, we recommend that women be at least 15 and men be at least 16 before considering a rhinoplasty procedure.  (Scott Trimas, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
