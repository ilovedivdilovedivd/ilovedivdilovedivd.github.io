<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Although most nose job procedures are performed when the individual is younger (re: late teens through early 30s), you can certainly have the operation later in life.</p><p>My primary concern when performing nose job on older individuals is that they have become used to a particular appearance as a result of having lived with it for so many years.</p><p>It isn’t uncommon for the results to seem rather dramatic at first given that even a very slight correction can appear rather significant when it comes to the nose.</p><p>That said, your desire to have the nose remain essentially the same, but have the dorsal bump removed is perfectly reasonable, particularly since it sounds like you have thought about this for many years.</p><p>Just express your desires and concerns to your surgeon and I am sure you will be more than pleased with the final outcome. (William F. DeLuca Jr, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>You’re never “too old” for nose job</h3><p>Unless there is a medical reason not to perform an elective surgical procedure on you, you are never too old to straighten your profile and get rid of the “bump” on your nose.</p><p>Sometimes it is necessary to perform some other maneuvers after the bump is removed to make sure the “roof” of the nose is “closed.”</p><p>If getting rid of this bump will make you feel better about yourself, I recommend you see a surgeon experienced in performing nose job to help address your concerns. (Adam Schaffner, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Age and nose job</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2017" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-326e6279312e456c66f14329a9eb3680">

</div><p>As long as you are in good health, age is not a factor in nose job. Select a well-trained Board Certified Facial Plastic or Plastic Surgeon. Upon consultation and examination your surgeon will be able to discuss the benefits, risks, and the expected results. (Michael Sullivan, MD, Columbus Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There is no “Age” limit for nose job</h3><p>My mother always hated her nose. She would often turn her face when someone was glancing at her so they would not see her profile.</p><p>Her greatest thrill was having her son “fix” her nose for her 68th birthday. If the patient is healthy and has no medical contraindications, age is not a limiting factor. (Marc Schneider, MD, Fort Myers Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job after 40</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2019" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Reshaping the external nose is a very rewarding procedure for both patient and doctor – removing a bump or modifying the tip of the nose, however is always done in conjuction with the entire nose as the sturcture doesn’t act in isolation. So I encourage you to choose a surgeon who understands this concept and can explain how he would minimize change to the tip and yet address the hump and allow the nose to look nice and natural once it is all said and done. (Paul E. Kelly, MD, Hamptons Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job in the 40’s</h3><p>There is no age restriction for nose job (except usually at least 14 in girls and 16 in boys, pending on growth patterns). As always general health should be satisfactory.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2018" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-06a1a06cc8830174602f4e0e25999fef">

</div><p>When removing the bump usualyl the lateral walls of the nose need to be narrowed lest the top of the nose will end up flat like a trapezoid. Sometimes some minor adjustment will also need to be made to the tip but this is up to you and the surgeon to discuss, perhaps illustrate with imaging. (Andrew Pichler, MD, Sacramento Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job in Late 40s</h3><p>As long as they we’re in good health, I’ve done rhinplasties in many patients a lot older than you. Over the past 35 years I’ve seen more Individuals like yourself, who have become educated about improved nose job techniques and safer anesthesia, choose to improve nasal appearance and function as adults. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job in older individuals</h3><p>Nose job can be done at any age. What constitutes an appropriate nasal re contouring is the artistic objectives as it relates to age of the patient. A younger individual can have dramatic reshaping of the nose but an older individual should not undergo significant changes as it can result in a “fake” look. I think you are right on as to just removing the hump and not doing much more to the rest of the nose. So as one get older the less is better. Good luck. (Sepehr Egrari, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job – O.K. after 40?</h3><p>Providing you are relatively healthy your age should not pose any particular problems as it relates to nose job surgery. Reducing the bridge will often necessitate mobilizing the nasal bones so that the nose remains narrow along the bridge line.</p><p>It will take a consultation with a nasal surgeon to determine which would be in your best interest. Either way you can obtain a natural un-operated look. (Jon F. Harrell, DO, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have done Rhinoplasties in patients in their 60’s and 70’s and it actually often makes people look younger. You have to make sure your nose is “age appropriate” and pretty but natural. A 14 year olds nose will not look right on a 40 year old. More importantly, you have to make sure your plastic surgeon understands your goals.</p><p>Too often I see patients who came out of a nose job with things they did not want or ask for. For example, you may be quite unhappy if your plastic surgeon takes it upon himself or herself to raise your tip and narrow your tip further or narrow your nostrils or anything else that you may not need nor asked for.</p><p>However, there may be some slight nuances that a skilled plastic surgeon can evaluate and recommend. Computer imaging should help you see the new nose and the new face and solidify the surgical “game plan.” (Shervin Naderi, MD, FACS, Washington DC Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>40 is a great age to pursue nose job</h3><p>There is no upper limit on a person’s age that would preclude them from pursuing rhinoplasty. As long as a person is healthy and has realistic expectations this surgery is appropriate for you.</p><p>Nose job is among the most complicated procedures that Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgeons perform so I would recommend finding someone with alot of experience with nasal surgery. (Stephen Weber, MD, FACS, Denver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Hump or Bump nose job (rhinoplasty) only</h3><p>Yes, it is possible for a hump only rhinoplasty to be completed. This may leave what we call and “open roof” which may require closure with bringing in of the nasal bones to close the opening. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best age for nose job</h3><p>Any age over 18 (for men) and 16 (for women), in general, is acceptable for a nose job procedure, assuming you are in good health. I recommend finding a board certified plastic surgeon or facial plastic surgeon who has a practice emphasis in rhinoplasty.</p><p>Additionally, ask to see plenty of before and after pictures so that you may develop a clear understanding of the style of surgery performed by that particular surgeon. (Glenn Vallecillos, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Only bump can be removed.</h3><p>See an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon who does natural noses. See live patients, not computer photos. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job at any age.</h3><p>Absolutely not! Many of our patients have nose job procedures a little later in life. Rhinoplasty is one of the most rewarding procedures for patients who are bothered by their nose. Just because you are considering a rhinoplasty, it doesn’t mean that you have to make “major” changes. Often, a “nosejob” is a procedure where minor changes are corrected. (Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD, Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>40 Year Old Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Grace if you are healthy, have reasonable expectation and just want the nasal “hump” removed – you sound like a good candidate for a nose job. I would probably recommend an endonasal nose job if you are happy with the rest of your nose and just want the hump removal. (Daniel Reichner, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is perfectly fine to have a nose job if you desire if you are older than 40. This is done quite often. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>40s, 50s, 60s all ok for nose job if your general health is good</h3><p>Your age is not a problem as long as you are generally healthy. As to just taking down the hump, i find that problematic. Usually when there is a dorsal hump there is a wide boney dorsum which also needs to be addressed. Then there is the relationship of the septum and upper lateral cartilages to the boney dorsum. So in essence it is important to look at the nose in its entirety and make a plan which addresses all the issues and gives you a aesthetic pleasing nose which lets you breath well through your nose.</p><p>Make sure you discussed all this with a board certified plastic surgeon who has experience which they can demonstrate with before and after photos. I have revised quite a number of rhinoplasties where the first surgeon just took down the hump. (Carl W. “Rick” Lentz III, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>No age limit for nose surgery</h3><p>If you are in good health, there is no age limit for having a nose surgery procedure. It certainly sounds like you have realistic goals about what can be accomplished. I would recommend a consultation with an experienced facial plastic surgeon who performs nose surgery regularly. (Anurag Agarwal, MD, Naples Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Late 40s Is Not Too Late for nose surgery</h3><p>You shouldn’t let age be a deterent in considering nose surgery. There is no age limit for nose surgery. As long as your health is good don’t let age be an issue. Regarding your bridge, an experienced nose surgery surgeon should be able to remove the bump but maintain the look of the rest of your nose. (Thomas A. Lamperti, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>40 year old nose surgery</h3><p>Fortunately, there is no age limit for nose surgery. Rather, when making a decision about any elective surgery, the overall health of the patient is the most important factor.</p><p>Furthermore, the problems that you describe can be addressed very easily in experienced hands. If all that is needed is the bump removed, this surgery can be done with incisions inside the nostrils only.</p><p>The nasal tip area isn’t involved at all, so you shouldn’t have any affect to that area at all. This procedure is usually very well tolerated and patients generally heal very quickly! (Andrew Winkler, MD, Lone Tree Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Is Late 40s Too Late for nose surgery?</h3><p>It is absolutely NOT too late to have a nose surgery if you are otherwise healthy. Moreover, a hump CAN be reduced without changing the size of the nostrils. You live in a town with a LOT of gifted Plastic surgeons and should have no problem finding a good one. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Timing of Nose Surgery (Rhinoplasty)</h3><p>40’s is certainly not too late to have nose surgery, although afterward you’ll likely be so pleased you’ll wish you had done it sooner. There are two general categories of aesthetic surgery: Procedures to change your look, and procedures to restore your look. nose surgery is in the former group, and is more characteristically sought by the young. Still, 40’s (and beyond) is not too old to make a change you’ve wanted for such a long time. You still have many years, and opportunities to enjoy the nice result. (Steve Laverson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>40s is a perfect age for nose surgery</h3><p>40 years old is not too old to have nose surgery. We often do nose surgery on people in their 60’s. You certainly can reduce the bump on the bridge without affecting the tip at all. (Jason B. Diamond, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
