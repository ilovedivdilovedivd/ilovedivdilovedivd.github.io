<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>To understand the difficulties or assymetry you are experiencing, it is necessary to have your preoperative photos, postoperative photos, and operative note available. (Arian Mowlavi, MD, Laguna Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is not uncommon in the early stages of rhinoplasty recovery to see some asymmetries. Often these asymmetries resolve themselves during the healing period.</p><p>It is usually 6 months before the nose is completely healed. Even though it is difficult, it is important to be patient during the early healing phase. (Michael Sullivan, MD, Columbus Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As other surgeons have noted it is common for there to be asymmetry – on every part of the body. That is certainly true on the nose and, because of its central and prominent location, any asymmetry is particularly noticeable.</p><p>You may, therefore, wind up with a certain degree of asymmetry (and there may have been some beforehand) but, regardless, it is MUCH too early to be concerned about this now.</p><p>It takes many weeks for much of the swelling to go down, and months to years (particularly for the tip) for the remainder to go down.</p><p>The process (waiting for the swelling to go down) is harrowing, but there is unfortunately nothing that can be done to speed it up.</p><p>You should, of course, talk to your own plastic surgeon about all of this, although I suspect you’ll get the same information and advice.  (Alan M. Engler, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after rhinoplasty takes 6-12 months to resolve</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2678" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-cb5346bf8529a797300e7202e2949973">

</div><p>You may have heard this and all the answers testify to this. Also, our body is NOT symmetrical. One side differs from other side. Basically, one side is longer than the other. This includes the face. If you look at any face, you will find out that one eyebrow is lower than the other. Sometimes this is very obvious while other time, it is not. This is due to facial asymmetry which makes one side of the face slightly shorter than the other side. The nose being in the center of the face, then may appear slightly curved. It may not be obvious before surgery, but after, when the nasal structures are refined, it becomes more obvious. Still, I will wait for complete resolution of the swelling before making a judgement on the result. (Mohsen Tavoussi, MD, DO, Huntington Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Recovery from rhinoplasty can take some time for the swelling to resolve and the tissues to settle. I would suggest discussing your concerns with your surgeon. Without examining your for seeing before and after photos, it is difficult to give specific advice. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>6 weeks post rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2680" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is way to early to see the final result of a rhinoplasty. You have to give it at least 6 months or longer to get a semblance of the final result. Even then you may wtill have swelling. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Different sides to nose after rhino</h3><p>Unfortunately it is far too early to tell, especially without a photo. For the first 3 months at least, swelling will vary day to day.</p><p>If you are feeling that bad I would suggest going in to talk to your doctor and have him reassure you. (Steven Schuster, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Post op rhinoplasty expectations</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2679" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Six weeks is considered early for rhinoplasty recovery, as most surgeons feel that the nose continues to heal and remodel for a full year. So my first advice is to stay patient.</p><p>Asymmetry during healing is also common, as well as soft tissue “memory” of the presurgical nose shape. Make sure you continue to work with your physician to voice your concerns. That way you get your questions answered, and the support you need.</p><p>Your physician may also consider the injection of a steroid called kenalog that helps reduce the amount of swelling or scar tissue deposition after surgery. Hang in there, your current shape is not the final result. (Kevin Robertson, MD, Madison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Healing Takes Many Months For Swelling To Subside</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2677" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2984ce0bd9766530ee6db3180fe2b84d">

</div><p>As you have only heard more than a dozen times by now, it is too early to judge what may be the final outcome of your rhinoplasty procedure. What may look asymmetrical at this point could well improve significantly in the next six months.</p><p>Most immediate postoperative rhinoplasty patients have some initial asymmetry and the final result may well show some subtle areas of asymmetry as well. This is not really the best forum for you to be airing these rhinoplasty concerns.</p><p>Talking to your rhinoplasty surgeon would be more appropriate and his comments would be a lot more reassuring as only he/she knows exactly how the surgery was done. (Barry L. Eppley, MD, DMD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose still twisted after six weeks</h3><p>After six weeks the nasal form has ‘set’ and the twist is likely to stay. The culprit may be memory in the cartilage much like a spring which can push the nose back after a repair. The best now is wait out a year and if the differences are a concern, revision may be necessary. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Perfect Nose</h3><p>I am not sure what the definition of the “perfect nose” is. Your surgeon should listen to what you want and not what they want. If they have digital imaging this can be helpful to communicate what you want.</p><p>Yes, all plastic surgeons have an idea what they want as an outcome but really it is your body and your choice. (Scott R. Brundage, MD, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty goals</h3><p>No one has a perfect nose. Even with a perfect nose job there are always very slight imperfections and nuances due to the variances in the healing process of a 3 dimensional structure that is composed of skin, 2 kinds of cartilage, and bone.</p><p>It is best to have a nose that balances with itself and the facial features, and looks quite natural. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I always have a lengthy discussion about patient goals and expectations prior to rhinoplasty. There is no reason to perform the same operation all the time. Patients always want different things. A good plastic surgeon always listens to your input. (Kenneth B. Hughes, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is avery strange sequence of statements and questions about your nose. Relax. Get more than one consultation from QUALIFIED people and then, perhaps, come back to this forum and ask again. You will know a lot more. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, FACS, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The perfect nose rhinoplasty</h3><p>Since you have to live with your nose, you should be happy with it. Make sure you find a surgeon who is a good listener and you feel comfortable with.</p><p>That trust is essential as he/she will be on the same page as you so you get the nose you like. If you go to a surgeon who will not give you what you are looking for, that is was second opinions are for 🙂  (Nima Shemirani, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The “perfect” nose</h3><p>I think you need to get another consult. Alar base resections can be done by themselves but they have their limitations. As long as you understand the limitations you may do very well with that procedure as long as it does not throw your nose out of balance. (Robert Kearney, MD, FACS, La Jolla Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Will I Need to Have a “Perfect” Nose?</h3><p>The “perfect” nose in unattainable in most instances and is aesthetically not required to make the face more naturally attractive. The goal of Rhinoplasty, IMHO, is the creation of a naturally more attractive, refined nose. Having said that, there are principles of facial aesthetics (including the nose) that should be understood and followed by any plastic and cosmetic surgeon performing Rhinoplasty or any treatment or surgery IMO. (Francis R. Palmer, III, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The goal of rhinoplasty is to look better but still natural</h3><p>There is no such thing as a perfect nose. You should discuss your goals with your surgeon and together figure out what is best for you. I find that computer imaging and even better, Vectra 3-D imaging can help with that discussion. Most rhinoplasties are to make the nose look better but not completely change the way you look. (Steven J. Pearlman, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Perfection in Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Nobody will push you to do anything you do not want. It is so very important that you choose a surgeon you trust with everything you have. Interview as many as it takes until you find “the one.” Rhinoplasty surgery is such an individualized procedure. No longer do we live in the day of “Dr X’s” nose. We are so good at looking at the individual’s nose and taking into account patient desires to deliver as close as possible to exactly what the patients wants. Do your research and pick the right surgeon and you will do great. (Richard J. Brown, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Need for a Perfect Nose</h3><p>It is your nose, and therefore a good experienced rhinoplasty surgeon will listen to your desires and then make the changes that you and that surgeon decide are appropriate for you. Every operation is individualized; over the past 35 years I’ve never done 2 noses exactly the same. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Getting the nose you want.</h3><p>Any experienced rhinoplasty surgeon should give you the kind of nose YOU want and not a nose he likes! (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The results would suit your present features and not look out of place on your face. Your goals are reasonable and I encourage you to discuss these concerns at your first consultation with you surgeon.</p><p>At your discussion, you should be able to ascertain if the prospective surgeon shares the same feelings regarding your nose. I would suggest going on multiple consultations so that you can be comfortable with the surgeon you choose. (Shim Ching, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
