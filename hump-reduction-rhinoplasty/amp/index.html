Your hump can be reduced with surgery improving your nasal profile, enhancing the shape of the nose.</p><p>Absolutely, This dorsal hump removal would be straightforward and causes very little alteration to your frontal view. It should look great. (Larry C. Leverett, MD, FACS, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A simple closed Rhinoplasty with rasping of the bump should be all that you need. Please do your homework and find an experienced Rhinoplasty surgeon who is board certified in Plastic Surgery. (Brooke R. Seckel, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can have just the nasal hump removed with minimal other changes to the nose. Removing the nasal hump may make that area of the nose appear wider and therefore the nasal bones are fractured inwards to minimise any increase in width.</p><p>Discuss your concerns with your surgeon and make sure you are comfortable before proceeding. (Guy Watts, MBBS (Hons), FRACS (Plast), Perth Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would not recommend a non-surgical rhinoplasty, as this would make your nose appear larger and less feminine. (Gregory Park, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Removing Just the Nasal Bump</h3><p>The bump can be removed without changing other features of your nose. Every nose should be individualized; in over 35 years I’ve never done 2 noses exactly the same. Work with an experienced rhinoplasty specialist so you achieve the natural result that you want.

Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3537" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-cc88f30cd85a6ec7e8555c2e66622829">

</div><h3>Can I just get the bump removed?</h3><p>Yes, you can have a rhinoplasty to remove just the bump. In fact, you are very pretty, so you do need very little! A non-surgical rhinoplasty typically involves fillers to shape the nose. Many times, this will make the nose appear larger. Which in your case would not be a good idea! (Francis R. Palmer, III, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bump Only is OK</h3><p>Dorsal Hump reduction alone would work well for you. This could be successfully accomplished with either the open or closed approach. Non-surgical rhinoplasty, meaning the injection of filler to mask a deformity, will not work. Make sure to choose a true rhinoplasty expert, and seek multiple consults. (Brian J. Reagan, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><center><div class="clearfix" id="gallery-1">

</div></center><h3>You can just have the dorsal hump on nose rasped flat.</h3><p>It’s a good idea to do the least that will get you to the look you want. You are bothered by the dorsal hump of your nose, and this can almost certainly be removed without doing anything else.</p><p>You have a “stately” nose, and it should be left that way. The hump on nose is small, and overall your nose is very attractive. In our New York City practice, your cost would be $7000, but costs are lower in other places. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>You could do a limited decrease of the ‘bump’</h3><p>You should consult a plastic surgeon who does a lot of nose surgery and find out what he/she thinks is possible.</p><p>I would need more views of your nose to say whether the ‘bump’ could simply be decreased, but I have a hunch you would need to have a ful ‘nose job’ to get it all to look right. (G. Gregory Gallico III, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>I agree with all the above answers, However</h3><p>It is difficult to give an definitive opinion based on one view. You certainly have a bump, but it also looks like the tip of your nose sticks out a little too far as well. Other views would show this better.</p><p>This is why not only are more views necessary. This is why I like using computer imaging to demonstrate when a hump on nose removal alone would work and when it would make the nose look out of balance, then the differences and alternatives can be discussed in better detail.</p><p>It is also hard to quote a fee since you might need more than just a “simple” hump removal. I perform a lot of revision rhinoplasties and what I hear often is that the original surgeon said it would be a “simple” procedures. All noses are different and each needs to treated individually as well as evaluated in person to give a full answer about what needs to be done. (Steven J. Pearlman, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Corrective Rhinoplasty</h3><p>The aesthetic complaint you have with your nose is common and easy to correct. I use video imaging as a component of assessment and education the patient. We can do the operation on the computer and make certain that the patient and surgeon have similar goals. The cost of a rhinoplasty is $5450 which includes all fees (surgeon, anesthesiologist, facility) and office visits. This should be close to the national average. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dorsal Hump on nose</h3><p>Yes, it is removable. It will involve shaving down the cartilaginous and the bony part of the hump on nose. After that is removed with a chisel, your nasal dorsum will be a bit flat instead of being narrow.</p><p>To make it narrow again the nasal bones are broken on the sides called (Osteotomies) and then both bones are pushed towards the center. That gives it the same narrow appearance as you have now but the hump on nose is gone. The usual <a href="../../recovery-time-for-nose-surgery/index.html" target="_blank">recovery time</a> is one week. Bruising varies but can last up to 2 weeks.</p><p>You will need one week off from work and/or school. It is not a difficult procedure. The cost varies anywhere from $2500 to $10,000 depending on the gegraphic area. (Tanveer Janjua, MD, Bedminster Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Hump on nose only removal is rare but possible.</h3><p>Removing the hump alone on nose is possible but rarely, since it often widens the look of your nose. Occasionally a break in your nasal bones needs to be made surgically (osteotomy) to renarrow this widened appearance.</p><p>Also, if the width of the upper part of the nose is narrowed, the tip structures often have to be changed to proportionally reduce the appearance of the nose. This keeps the tip from sticking out too much visually. Proportion and balance are the keys to a quality rhinoplasty surgery. (Manish H. Shah, MD, FACS, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>“Hump” on the Nose and Surgery</h3><p>It is easy to think that one could just reduce the size of a hump and that would resolve your problem. However, especially in the nose, even a millimeter or two makes a difference in proportions of the nose relatively.</p><p>That is, if your hump is reduced, then the width of the nose may appear top be too wide. Then the nasal bones would need to be moved closer. Once this is done, the relative proportion of the cartilages of the tip of the nose may appear to “bulbous” and some type of reduction would be necessary there as well.</p><p>Although it is likely you would need work on the nasal bones (including the hump on nose) as well as the cartilages, photos cannot reveal what would be necessary in your situation. The costs involved would depend on how much work needs to be done and can range from $5,000 up for the surgical fees and depending on what area of the country you live in. (Theodore Katz, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>You have options</h3><p>I would need other views. Certainly the hump on nose can be taken down, but you may need an onlay graft too, depending on the exam. I notice that you have a “weak” chin, and you may benefit from orthodontia and/or a chin augmentation. sek (Scott E. Kasden, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
