<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Celebrities nose jobs are often in the news. The key element to success is looking natural. The surgeon needs to design and plan a rhinoplasty based upon your facial features not on a celebrity’s nose.</p><p>One cannot have an Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt nose if one has different facial features. It would not look good and would actually look unnatural in most cases. Unfortunately, many celebrity nose jobs and even those that are famous models do not have very good nose jobs and have significant nasal tip and dorsal problems.</p><p>It is not uncommon that patients bring in celebrity nose jobs and I tell them that the imperfections and the asymmetries that they have really would not A. look good on the celebrity and B. would not look good on them. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Ethically speaking, perfection is not something that can only be “afforded”. I believe a plastic surgeon should treat every rhinoplasty patient with the same diligence and drive for aesthetic beauty regardless of that patient’s income or social/celebrity status.</p><p>In dealing with operating on celebrities on a regular basis, I can tell you that they are just as concerned as everyone else in getting the best possible results at the best possible price.</p><p>Although you should never bargain shop for your plastic surgery, you should also not assume that the highest price means you will get the best results.</p><p>As some people say, “The proof is in the pudding.” Take a look at a surgeons work on-line and take the time to meet them in a real or virtual consultation in order to determine if they may be the right surgeon for you! (Gary Motykie, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1690" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-16b7d9538b3f4d487a142a265db14115">

</div><p>You can have even better than celebrities, provided you do your research. Many fantastic surgeons are unassuming, very hard working, technically excellent, and humble. They don’t promote themselves, but crank out incredible results daily.</p><p>Celebrities gravitate toward “known” surgeons, many of whom seek celebrity status themselves. These surgeons are also often good, but not always, and not necessarily any better in any way than the guy down the street.</p><p>Check before and after photos, and be sure your desired outcome coincides with your surgeon’s plan. You must feel confident in and comfortable with your surgeon. (Steve Laverson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Perfection in rhinoplasty is not a matter of money</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1691" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-ba102a33119689a43842b0af9a9f4c6b">

</div><p>That’s right. There is no amount of money anyone can spend to obtain a “perfect” rhinoplasty outcome, because: There is no way to predict outcome 100% of the time. Some revisions will be needed around 15% of the cases, therefore statistically there is no way to pay a certain amount of money and guaranteeing no revisions</p><p>So many variables are at play that the outcome can be maximized by surgeon experience, but not associated with professional fees. Many (if not most) of the true artists in this specialty are not necessarily the “surgeons to the stars” Patients should evaluate a Doctor’s outcomes and make sure that his/her plan fits their own. That is the best way to reduce disappointments and surprises. (Mario Diana, MD, Plano Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrity Nose Jobs</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1693" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-9ae2f743da18db5fa561f2cd26cb2709">

</div><p>Just because you are in the public as a celebrity and you have tons of money does not guarantee that you will be able to buy perfection for your nose job. Belive it or not celebrities have the same skin, bone and cartilage as you do.</p><p>There are a lot of very skilled nose surgeons in the USA. Even if there was a way to determine “the best” nose surgeon,( you can’t go by the fact a person claims to be “the best”) and there is really no good mechanism to do so.</p><p>That person on a given day or set of circumstances might have an untoward result that doesn’t look good. Find someone you are comfortable with that doesn’t challange your economic position and see if the work the surgeon has done is what you are looking for. In any event, you need to be seen in person by a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon to assist you in making a decision as to what is best for you.  (Jon Sattler, MD, Glendora Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1692" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0bd9af67fa10f450931b6e2bee317cc2">

</div><h3>Celebrity Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Remember, many celebrities have a talent that nets them great wealth but does not necessarily create good judgment. Far too often we see terribly overdone work on entertainers. A typical patient seeking Rhinoplasty who exercises basic common sense working with an ethical and skillful surgeon giving good advice will have very nice outcomes. And you will pay much less. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Any true board certified plastic surgeon treats all patients equally both in and out of the operating room. We pride ourselves on our results not necessarily our clients status.  (Ryan Stanton, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrity Nose Jobs: Better Than What I Can Get?</h3><p>Celebrities work in an industry that places much importance on the appearance of beauty and youth. Thus patients undergoing surgery place a high level of importance on the results from rhinoplasty.</p><p>Rhinoplasty is not different for celebrities, however they must allow sufficient time for healing and swelling to resolve before their next professional shoot or public event.</p><p>In terms of the best rhinoplasty surgeon, it is beneficial to spend time researching your surgeon, so that you feel comfortable that the procedure will match your expectations.</p><p>A surgeon who shares your aesthetics and is open with you showing you before and after photographs as well as testimonials. (Julian De Silva, MD, London Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>You too deserve the same treatment as a celebrity when getting an nose job</h3><p>Celebrities are not necessarily getting better nose jobs than the average Joe. They may have access to resources that steer them in the direction of top docs, but there are plenty of poorly executed procedures on celebrities as well.</p><p>You don’t have to be a celebrity to find an excellent surgeon and you don’t have to be a celebrity doc to do excellent surgery.</p><p>Find a surgeon that is well trained, evaluate before and after pictures, and talk to other patients. This is the best way to find the physician that is right for you. (Arthur N. Falk, MD, Albany Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrity Nose Jobs</h3><p>Celebrities have experienced a range of nose jobs. They can vary from natural, great results to bad, poorly executed results. It all depends on the expertise and background of the facial plastic surgeon. If you are considering a rhinoplasty, make sure to do your research and communicate very well what you want out of the procedure. (Carlo Honrado, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty is no different for a celebrity</h3><p>Rhinoplasty on a celebrity does not differ in any way. The nose is treated with the highest level of care whether you are a celebrity or not. Each patient is given the upmost attention during the consultation, surgery, and postoperative care. (Richard A. Zoumalan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Famous or Infamous – Celebrity Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Judging your plastic surgeon should be based on his or her training and experience and proven results from before and after photos.</p><p>The techniques used in performing rhinoplasty on a celebrity are no different than the techniques used for any other person. Usually surgeons who have a good reputation are selected by celebrities for their surgery.</p><p>However, in this day and age good public relations can “create” a reputation, which means that as a consumer you need to be that much more aware and selective when it comes to choosing your surgeon. (Cory Goldberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrity Nose Jobs</h3><p>While it is true that many celebrities undergo rhinoplasty (or cosmetic surgery in general), it is not a given that they receive better treatment or get better results. “Perfection” in rhinoplasty is a difficult concept – there are so many factors involved (the patient’s tissues and healing capacity, post-operative care, surgeon skill, etc.) that it isn’t really possible to say that one group of patients get better results. The reality is that your relationship with your surgeon is among the best predictors of your results. Price and fame aren’t everything. (Evan Ransom, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrity Nose Jobs: Better Than What I Can Get?</h3><p>Celebrity noses are no different from noses in the general public. You just hear more about them and see their photos everywhere. Their noses are sometimes done for publicity reasons and to make them more attractive at the box office. Although I’ve seen some very good rhinoplasties in the celebrity crowd I have also seen some awful noses.</p><p>The key is to find a plastic surgeon that is competent and experienced and makes you feel good at the consultation. Look at his pre and postop photos. Does the surgeon act confident? Check his credentials. Make sure that he is a board certified Plastic Surgery. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrities Don’t Get Better Nose jobs</h3><p>I would say “no” to your question. I think I can speak for the doctors here in that we always do our best to provide a result that patients love whether they are famous or not. What’s also interesting is that with rare exceptions, many “celebrities” got their rhinoplasty surgeries prior to becoming famous. It’s difficult for a celebrity to make any changes to their nasal shape after they step into the limelight. For instance, just think of Barbra Streisand or Owen Wilson. Both have aspects of their nose that are not “ideal,” but to change now would create a departure from what the public expects them to look like. (Michael M. Kim, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Celebrities get the same results from a rhinoplasty as anyone else. They do not receive special rhinoplasty techniques unavailable to the general population. Celebrities do have access to the best rhinoplasty surgeons in the country, just like everyone else does. Remember that their success depends on how they look on a tight shot on camera or a movie set.</p><p>It’s a good idea to look for a very experienced rhinoplasty surgeon who dedicated a significant portion of their practice to the discipline of rhinoplasty and is passionate about performing the procedure.</p><p>For many examples of rhinoplasty, please see the link below (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Just because someone has a lot of money to spend or fame, it does not necessarily mean that he or she will get the best medical care. That is espcially true of cosmetic surgery. I have seen some pretty awful looking rhinoplasties and facelifts on well know actors and actresses.</p><p>If you do your homework and go to a surgeon who does a lot of rhinoplasty, you should expect as good a result as anyone else. Take a careful look at the variety of post op results posted on a surgeon’s website. Do the noses look natural or operated? Do all the noses look the same? (Stuart H. Bentkover, MD, Boston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrities benefit from their image professionals</h3><p>As you can tell from all the answers thus far, you get the same attention to detail that a celebrity might seem to get. Good physicians treat all their patients like they are the only one that matters.</p><p>What I think set’s apart patients perception of celebrity surgery results is the additional perks that celebrity commands. If time and money become secondary considerations, then we all could have professional make up artists, hair stylists, personal trainers, and image consultants.</p><p>These disciplines can really build upon cosmetic surgery results. I am sure if you have seen the before and after make up pictures of models, you will see the point I am also trying to make. (Kevin Robertson, MD, Madison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Everyone is a celebrity for Rhinoplasty</h3><p>The celebrities that have seen the spot light have had good and bad nose work done. In my practice I give everyone the same focus and attention they deserve. We have all seen bad results and some really good ones. Sometimes it is simply a miscommunication between the patient and surgeon about what the goals are and how realistic the outcomes can be.</p><p>Some doctors may give in to outrageous celebrity requests and not recognize the pressures and influence of their careers on decisions they make regarding surgery. Therefore, whether you are a celebrity or not, an ethical surgeon should know who and who NOT to operate on.</p><p>Once the decision is made proper communication, an experienced and caring surgeon, and realistic expectations should produce great and natural results for everyone! (Ashkan Ghavami, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrity plastic surgery</h3><p>There are examples of celebrities who have had wonderful plastic surgery. Most of the celebrities who have had subtle artistic work are never in the news because their results were subtle, their surgeries were never leaked to the press; they appear to continue to defy age.</p><p>You will never hear those plastic surgeons’ names because they quietly perform their work and respect patient confidentiality by not leaking details of their patients’ surgeries to the press. Celebrities refer their friends, and so on. Things go wrong when the celebrity is just not happy with their result, and continues to request more. and more. and more.</p><p>Responsible plastic surgeons will decline to operate when it is not good for the patient or when the patient has psychological issues that makes them unable to see themselves for how they really are, or to accept what cannot reasonably be changed. Usually celebrities are used to getting what they want, and they will typically walk out the door and find another doctor to perform the work they want.</p><p>Celebrities generally have the money and resources to pick the best surgeons for their work. Just like any circle of friends, if they are happy with their work, they refer their close friends. (Brent Moelleken, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The “Celebrity” is treated with the same respect and professionalism as is expected by any other pt</h3><p>You may be wondering if a “celebrity” patient may get special treatment that a surgeon would not typically afford to any other less well-known patient? As far as in my practice, and I think for most of my collegues, all of my patients are treated with the same degree, or level of care by both me and my staff. I feel very grateful to have been selected by my patients to be their surgeon- and thus do not distinguish depending on persons status, or other issues that are unrelated to the patient/physician relationship we have.
