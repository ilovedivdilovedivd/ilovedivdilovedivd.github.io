Surgery on high profile individuals is actually MORE anxiety-provoking than surgery on low profile individuals, so in this regard many surgeons prefer the latter.</p><p>While my friends joke that I am a ‘plastic surgeon to the stars’, I immediately remind them that my practice is in Baltimore, where the movie and music industry is a tad less advanced than in LA or NYC! (Our celebrities tend to be professional athletes or TV personalities.)</p><p>I will say this.unlike the average joe, a celebrity’s career success is often a direct function of how they look, ie how dashing or how beautiful. Therefore, when these individuals undergo rhinoplasty, they are potentially altering that which has contributed to their fame.</p><p>In the case of Ashley Simpson or Megan Fox, rhinoplasty worked wonders. In the case of Jennifer Grey and MJ, not so much.</p><p>Rhinoplasty surgeons are aware of this, but generally provide the identical same care to all patients. In the words of another surgeon, every patient is a celebrity! That’s the bottom line. (Randolph Capone, MD, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We all have access to the same surgeons as the celebrities. Remember , we’ve all seen less than desireable results in some celebrities.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1702" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Pick your surgeon based on their experience, and results you’ve seen on their website and during consultation. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty and celebrities</h3><p>Who says that celebrities make the right choice. Having access to money does not necessarily mean that they get the best as we have all seen recently in the media. You should select a plastic surgeon based on his/ her work- as shown on their gallery. (Siamak Agha, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrity Rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1703" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-614c45bb03f5a1ab883cf69378a6c227">

</div><p>I find that celebrities tend to choose celebrity plastic surgeons, not necessarily the most skilled plastic surgeons. In fact, some of the best quality work is done by surgeons you have never heard of.</p><p>I bet if you asked 100 plastic surgeons around the nation who does the best noses, you would get the same 10 people probably in roughly the same order – probably none of whom you have ever heard their names.</p><p>Remember, celebrities are just like you an me except that they live in the public eye. Their knowledge of the medical world is the same as most and some find the right people and some do not. (Jay Calvert, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrity Nose Job Results</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1704" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-616770de351ecbe132babf5831dfd60f">

</div><p>You only have to open the most recent tabloid or scan the television to see that a good number of celebrities have had poor outcomes from rhinoplasty surgery. Sure, you have to pay a certain amount of money to a reputable, experienced rhinoplasty surgeon for their skill and services.</p><p>Average price for rhinoplasty in your particular region is even accessible here on this site. But just because a celebrity pays more money does not mean they enjoy superior outcomes. There are plenty of well-known rhinoplasty surgeons throughout the United States who charge reasonable rates and can provide you with a great result.</p><p>Also keep in mind that seeking ‘perfection’ in rhinoplasty is unrealistic. This is usually a red flag for surgeons when they hear this during any consultation. As surgeons we are certainly always striving for perfection, but having this expectation following rhinoplasty is a setup for disappointment. (John M. Hilinski, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1705" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-05d5972330a5ce9da40cb071f12d1b9e">

</div><h3>Do celebrities have better nose surgeries?</h3><p>Some do some don’t. Its all a matter of who you have doing your surgery. It’s very important that you do your home work, Find a Facial Plastic Surgeon or Plastic surgeon who specializes in nose surgery,</p><p>Look at their before and after photos, interview a few surgeons and don’t be shy about asking them questions. You should ask them to image you on a computer as well as show you pictures of people they imaged and what their ultimate results were (any one can do good imaging).</p><p>After doing all the above ask around to see if anyone has actually had surgery with that physician and see what their experience was. And finally, make sure they are board certified. Good Luck. (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Celebrities are not immune to making the wrong choices when it comes to choosing a Plastic Surgeon.</p><p>One would think they would have some kind of ‘insider’ advantage, and some may – but all one has to do is look at the amazing amount of sub-par work displayed by many celebrities to realize they do not always make good choices.</p><p>Some of them had their surgery before they had money or connections. Others have surgery performed by ‘society’ surgeons who are well connected socially but aren’t particularly gifted technically.</p><p>Another problem patients, including celebrities, have is that even good surgeons are not good at everything.</p><p>Rhinoplasty is a prime example of a difficult to learn and master surgery. Anyone, including a celebrity would be well advised to do a lot of research into their nose job before choosing a surgeon. (Jon F. Harrell, DO, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Do celebrities get better nose jobs?</h3><p>An excellent question! And the answer is no they don’t. There are many well qualified and experienced rhinoplasty surgeons around the country.</p><p>The great majority of rhinoplasty patients can find a local surgeon who can help them realize their goals.</p><p>There are occasions where a highly experienced surgeon specializing in rhinoplasty may be the best option but for most people, great results can be obtained locally. (Jeffrey E. Kyllo, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon</p><h3>Celebrity nose jobs</h3><p>The techniques used on celebrities are the same techniques available for use on non-celebrities. Celebrity rhinoplasty is not necessarily better (you can see many examples of bad ones) because the patient is famous and spent a lot of money. The level of perfection obtained with a nose job is not a matter of price. The surgeons that are chosen by celebrities are usually ones who have built a reputation of consistently high quality work. You cannot do some rhinoplasties well and others carelessly and still have a good reputation.</p><p>As a surgeon you must aim for high quality results on every patient. When you operate on the nose of a celebrity, that nose is photographed and filmed under all kinds of lighting and from every different angle. This demands precision and meticulous technique. However, talented rhinoplasty surgeons do this for all of their patients since 1) it is what each patient deserves, and 2) it is their reputation on the line. Be careful when selecting your surgeon, and do your research. Advertisements can be misleading. (Anita Patel, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>There is nothing special about “celebrity nose jobs”.</strong></p><p>I can think of one famous pop singer who had several “celebrity” nose jobs. Didn’t look so good to me. Getting good results from a rhinoplasty means lots of pre-surgical research by the patient. Check credentials, photos, interviews, etc. before making a choice. Most plastic surgeons get predictably good results. If you know a celebrity that had a result that was good, go ahead and give them a call and find out who there surgeon was. It’s a good place to start. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celebrity rhinoplasty</h3><p>I am not particularly impressed with a lot of the cosmetic work that celebrities have had. I consider a lot of it overdone and extreme. I prefer a more subtle change that is clearly an improvement but not an alien transformation. The answer to your question is, “no”. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best celebrity rhinoplasty</h3><p>Not necessarily. Appearance-wise, celebrities have an advantage over most of us, but it is not necessarily because of their plastic surgeon.</p><p>Most of the time when seen in magazines, movies, TV or public appearances it is after they have had the help of professional hairdressers, make-up artists and photographers who use their talents to make the celebrity as attractive as possible. Think of what these professionals were able to do to Brad Pitt in the movie, Benjamin Buttons. It is what these professionals can do to change the appearance of a person.</p><p>On the other hand, look at what the celebrity surgeons did for Michael Jackson and what his “celebrity” personal physician did to him. There are excellent plastic surgeons in all areas of the United States, you need to be diligent in your search (see previous RealSelf questions, “How to find a plastic surgeon”) and it is not an easy task since it is no longer unethical for plastic surgeons to use paid misleading advertising and marketing. (Jack P. Gunter, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celeb nose jobs</h3><p>Celeb do not get better nose surgery that “ordinary” people. In fact, some actors and actresses have had horrible results. I could name several, such as poor Michael Jackson.</p><p>Good plastic surgeons have all had their share of celebrities; but I have no doubt that they do their best during every operation, no matter who the patient is.</p><p>Plastic surgeons who are very busy get referrals from satisfied patients who recommend their friends. Celebrities will often not admit that they had surgery, so doing a great job on every patient is important as well as ethical. (Howard T. Bellin, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celeb ususally choose their surgeons based on word of mouth</h3><p>In general a celebrity will choose their surgeon based on word of mouth and that is a sure fire way to make sure that their surgeon is top notch. Certainly there are results of bad celeb nose jobs; MJ for example, but that was in years past. Most of the celebrities here in Beverly Hills are very private and require after hours and weekend surgeries etc because the press is always looking to pry into their personal lives. You rarely hear about the celebs who get work done and most of them look amazing and make fortunes based on their appearances. The point of all this is that you should find your surgeon based on word of mouth, not based on price or marketing gimmicks or Google positions etc. (Jason B. Diamond, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celeb Nose Job is no different than yours!</h3><p>Patients coming in for a rhinoplasty all have the same concerns – is it going to look good, will I see a big difference, will my friends know (or not know) that I had something done, and what will I look like. Why would you think that celebrities are deserve or get any better a rhinoplasty than you. Just look at some of the rhinoplasties on movie stars. I certainly would not want my results to look like some of theirs.</p><p>The surgery, whether open or closed is done the same way and the results will vary based on the skill of the surgeon, the skin type, and the extent of the deformity. Find a surgeon you feel comfortable with and is qualified to perform the surgery. Ask to see representative photos of their work. And when all is said and done the result that makes you feel like a celebrity when you look in the mirror. (Steven Schuster, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celeb rhinoplasty should be no different than any other person</h3><p>My practice is in Beverly Hills. I often treat patients of many different backgrounds and careers. It does not matter whether a patient is a celeb or not. The rhinoplasty will be performed with the same amount of attention to detail in all cases. (John Diaz, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Celeb nasal surgery is no different than any ordinary citizen</h3><p>The major difference between a celeb undergoing a rhinoplasty and an ordinary person undergoing the same procedure is that most people who have a rhinoplasty are willing to admit that they have had one whereas most celebrities are reluctant to do so unless confronted or the evidence is obvious. The success rate for rhinoplasty is 85 to 90%, that is, not requiring some sort of minor revision. Even celebrity noses have about the same rate of revision as the general population.</p><p>No one surgeon can guarantee the healing process of an individual and even in the best of hands patients can heal with less than ideal results. Furthermore, if you look at celebrities closely, you will see that their noses are not always perfect and they often have little bumps, irregularities or asymmetries present but make up artists can do an excellent job hiding those areas on film and TV.</p><p>So in summary, it is always best to do your homework and make sure your surgeon has done a lot of rhinoplasties. Typically, facial plastic surgeons perform the greatest number of them but there are some general plastic and cosmetic surgeons who also have that added training. (Scott Trimas, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>All patients are the same</h3><p>I treat every patient the same. The reason we make decisions in medicine is that we choose the path that will give the best outcome with the least risk. Thinking that someone will get a better treatment because they are a “VIP” is not valid. More likely than not, if a doctor modifies their regime to accommodate a VIP, they are probably compromising their usual good techniques.</p><p>(A simple example would be a celeb who doesn’t want to wear the nasal splint for 5 days – maybe they could “handle it” for the weekend, but not the following week. Physiology doesn’t change! There is a very good reason why the splint is recommended for a certain length of time, and that should not be compromised.) So in my practice – every patient gets the best treatment I can offer, no matter who you are! (Michael A. Bogdan, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Every patient is a celeb</h3><p>As far as plastic surgery is concerned every individual is a celeb. A good surgeon who is passionate about his work and his patients will consider that at the time the surgery is being performed that patient, either rich, poor, famous or anonymous becomes the most important person in the world. No special techniques or special “gold sutures” are available only to be used for special people.</p><p>We are driven to deliver the ultimate best outcome for the needs of our patients whomever that might be. Ocasionally special considerations of privacy and confidentiality are taken with some “high profile” personalities but that has no reflections on them receiving different medical care or improved results. (Arturo Guiloff, MD, Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I supose I treat everyone as a celebrity, but really I treat them as if I am treating my own family member. I want them to have a great result, a great experience, and I want them to feel that all their questions and concerns were addressed during every stage of the experience. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
