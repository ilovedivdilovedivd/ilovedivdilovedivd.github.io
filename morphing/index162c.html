(Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty and Computer Imaging</h3><p>I routinely use computer imaging to not only show patients what their nose may look like after rhinoplasty, but also as a tool for myself to measure the appropriate amount of change planned for the procedure.</p><p>I find that the profile view is most reliable and accurate in predicting the result. I am unable to comment on the “effect of narrowing” your nose based on your picture, as one would need a frontal view to begin the discussion. I strongly agree with Dr. Mayer that anyone can “Photoshop” a nose to make it look better on a computer, his son, my daughter, but you want to choose your rhinoplastic surgeon most carefully based on actual patient results, look at before and afters, and try to meet or speak with some of your surgeon’s previous patients. (Michael A. Persky, MD, Encino Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Predicting outcomes in Rhinoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2183" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Computer imaging is an invaluable tool for patients seeking cosmetic alterations to their face and neck. While words can be used to describe desires and expected outcomes, using a visual medium truly enhances the communication between doctor and patient. I do computer imaging on all of my patients.</p><p>I tell them that it is not a guarantee of a result, but rather a language for communication and understanding of each other’s goals. I make every effort to image a realistic outcome based upon a particular surgical plan. What I don’t do is to image first and then figure out how to get there because if you “over-image”, then you risk falling short of your goals. The best way to find out more is to look at the before and after photos of real patients. If the doctor in question does computer imaging, then ask to see imaging that was done on the noses you like.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2185" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-36c24cac843449a763e341d04c3080b6">

</div><p>This will give you an idea of how close the projected and actual outcomes are. Finally, remember that Rhinoplasty is a complicated surgery where a small degree of unpredictability may occur during the healing phase. There are also occasional surprises during operations that change overall the surgical plan. This is why imaging projections and outcomes aren’t always an exace match. However, they should be reasonably close, if done correctly. (Richard W. Westreich, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Computer imaging is very useful but it is only an educational device</h3><p>Computer imaging is only one tool that is commonly used to educate the patient about what is possible. It is of course much easier to do a rhinoplasty on the computer than surgically. A complete exam is necessary to assess the quality of your skin as well as your bone and cartilage structure. Computer imaging while a useful tool is not a guarantee of a result. (Jeffrey Zwiren, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div></center><h3>Evaluate previous patient’s photos to determine what results are realistic following rhinoplasty.</h3><p>There are many programs that allow a surgeon to “morph” a photograph to illustrate post-operative results. I do no recommend this.</p><p>I have seen many patients from other surgeons unhappy when their actual result did not resemble their “morphed” photo.</p><p>I recommend you meet with many surgeons and review actual surgical results. Your surgeon should review you photos and explain to you areas that could be improved.</p><p>I will often draw on the profile photo what I think will be an attractive nose. Visit with Board Certified Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, Cosmetic Surgeons, or General Plastic Surgeons. (Gregory Pippin, MD, Metairie Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Computer 3d imaging before Rhinoplasty</h3><p>The most common form of viewing possible changes with Rhinoplasty is computer 3d imaging. Most nasal specialists would offer this to the patients during the consultation.</p><p>I find it a useful tool to communicate with the patient as to the desired results. Be careful, not all surgeon that cam perform “computer 3d imaging surgery” can deliver that result in the operating room. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Computer morphing does not replace patient-physician discussion</h3><p>The photos which are taken for computer morphing include static and dynamic (smiling) views in at least 7 different full face poses, which are clearly defined. Each “click of the mouse” or morphing move corresponds to a surgical manuever, which can be incorporated into the surgical “flight plan”.</p><p>However theoretical concerns must be related to the patient’s age, gender, height, aesthetic ideals, etc. The bottom line is that despite cultural, historical conventions a nose should compliment the patient’s features, neither dominate or detract from the midface. Find a PS who has an active interest and expertise in rhinoplasty and be completely candid with him/her. (Lavinia K. Chong, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A Picture is Worth a 1000 Words</h3><p>I find computer-generated 3d imaging (CGI) very helpful during a rhinoplasty consultation. While not all cosmetic surgeons offer this benefit, CGI is an intricate part of the consultation process in my office. The morphing software allows us the opportunity to communicate and visualize goals before any surgery takes-place. Rhinoplasty is one of the most difficult of cosmetic procedures. In addition to being technically challenging to create certain physical changes, there is a great diversity in anatomy and patient goals. Indeed, no two rhinoplasties are exactly the same.</p><p>The goals of one patient may be very different from another. CGI gives us the opportunity to make each procedure a fine-tuned, unique event. I don’t believe in creating cookie-cutter noses and CGI can help us create a customized surgical plan that honors your ethnicity and unique characteristics.</p><p>You current photograph is a bit difficult to morph if you are looking to narrow your nose. A portrait format would work better. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavor. If our office can be of any assistance, please give us a call. For more information on 3-D Imaging that Dr. Mabrie uses during your evaluation, click the link below. (David Mabrie, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty 3d Imaging can help ‘show’ results, but may not be realistic</h3><p>Computer rhinoplasty 3d imaging is a useful ‘tool’, however, realize that some surgeons may use it to oversell unrealistic results. 3d imaging does help showcase potential results and is especially useful in showing the profile view. It is important to seek out a board certified plastic surgeon when searching for a rhinoplasty surgeon. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Morphing – An Important Rhinoplasty Tool</h3><p>Morphing is excellent tool for the modern rhinoplasty surgeon. Morphing allows the rhinoplasty surgeon to:</p><ol>
<li>Morphing communicates the artistic goals of the surgery with the patient. We all have different standards of beauty and morphing is a fantastic way to confirm that the surgeon and patient are on the same page.</li>
<li>Morphing establishes a “blue print” or guide for the surgeon. The surgeon will be more efficient in the operating room with a plan based on the changes established by the morphed views.</li>
<li>Morphing establishs a standard of excellence for the surgeon.</li>
</ol><p>I provide the morphed image to all my patients. While I tell them that the morphed image is only a goal and not a guarentee – it establishes a high artistic standard of excellence for the best surgeons.</p><p></p>
<center><div class="wp-video amp-wp-inline-3e51218d663451eff35d5e808dc532fc"><amp-video class="wp-video-shortcode" width="400" height="400" controls="" layout="responsive"><source type="video/mp4" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rhinoplasty-3d-imaging-videoe6f8.html?_=2"></amp-video></div></center><p>I also recommend consulting with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who understands the antatomic limitations, artistic proportions and how to translate these into a realistic morphed photograph. (Daniel Reichner, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Imaging</h3><p>Imaging using digital photography and computer software is common. Some newer 3-D applications are available, as well.</p><p>The images serve as a great tool to communicate with your surgeon about your desires and what he thinks is achievable. (Paul C. Zwiebel, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Computer Imaging for Realistic Expectations</h3><p>Computer imaging is a particularly effective technique for allowing patients to achieve realistic expectations as to the outcome of their rhinoplasty procedure.</p><p>Using computer imaging, alterations such as taking down a bump, rotating a tip, narrowing a bridge, and refining the tip can all be visualized, allowing the patient to actually see how they are likely to look, and use that to provide feedback to the surgeon as to whether that is how he/she wants to look.</p><p>It is crucial, for computer imaging to be realistic, is to make sure that your surgeon is not only good at achieving nice results on the computer but also on actual patients. (Jeffrey Epstein, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Aesthetic imaging</h3><p>In my office we have used a “Mirror imaging system” for almost 20 years. It can give the patient a very accurate portrail of an expected rhinoplasty result so long as the surgeon is honest with the patient. I always back this process up by showing the patient books and books of actual rhinoplasty before and afters photos that I have done to let them see “real”results.</p><p>Imaging can be great to help a patient visualise his likely results, however real photos attest to the likely outcome much better, and should also be provided. On the picture you have provided (side view ) all I can say is that there is a small hump that would be nice to remove, the nose itself is in need of moving back to your face slightly, and the columella labial angle beneath the nose needs to be made more towards 90 degrees.</p><p>It is also important that your nose not be shortened or turned up at all. (Richard Galitz, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Computer morphing a useful rhinoplasty consultation tool</h3><p>There are multiple programs available for rhinoplasty surgeons to perform preoperative morphing. I find it to be an invaluable tool to communicate with patients so that I can best determine what changes (and to what level) they are interested in making. It is important to recognize that the images are not a guarantee of results but do represent the goal we’re working for.</p><p>Though many surgeons use morphing software, not all surgeons perform the morphing themselves. I find that performing the morphing myself with the patient and having a dialogue with them about their goals is the most fruitful. The surgeon is best able to assess what can and cannot be done during surgery, given the anatomic constraints. (Thomas A. Lamperti, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Morphing Is A Very Valuable Tool in Rhinoplasty</h3><p>Most surgeons serious about rhinoplasties make extensive use of morphing software. The final results will never look identical to the morphed image but should resemble it. The morphed image is an invaluable communication tool. The software helps the surgeon and patient agree on the goals of surgery. Here the old adage of a picture is worth 1000 words definitely applies. During the consultation the surgeon should be able to make changes on the image and tell you the likely success rate of these changes.</p><p>For example, taking a hump off the nose is accurately predicted with morphing software with great success. Other changes are predicted based on the specifics of the patient. In my consultations I will not simply morph your nose into the ideal shape. I will morph your nose into a shape that is as close to ideal as I think is achievable. I will further point out what aspects are extremely likely and what things may have more variability. (Louis W. Apostolakis, MD, Austin Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is possible to do computer imaging for nose job. However, you must keep in mind that this is just imaging and the computer cannot predict how your own tissues will react to the surgery.</p><p>However, you are able to get a general idea of what your nose would look like. For your question about what your nose would look like.</p><p>It is impossible to comment specifically on the width since the picture is so small. However, your nose does appear wide and nose job could definitely narrow your nose.</p><p>As for your profile, nose job could straighten your dorsum (hump). I would need to see other views to comment further on your nose.</p><p>Additionally, prior to surgery, you need a good exam of the inside of your nose. You do not want to make changes to the appearance of your nose while altering the function of breathing. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A simulation is not a guarantee of final nose job results</h3><p>In my office, I routinely use digital simulation to explain my nose job procedures to patients. I use the simulation with the assistance of the patient to come up with mutual goals for surgery.</p><p>I always make it known that a simulation is not a guarantee of outcome. There are many factors beyond the control of the surgeon that could alter the end product.</p><p>I also know when a patient is being unreasonable by the extent of simulation and will be able to let them know that their requests are not possible. (Manish H. Shah, MD, FACS, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Computer imaging for rhinoplasty preview</h3><p>The best computer imaging is done usually in the office with a professional-grade camera, proper lighting and background color. Complex-type computer imaging programs that are best suited for this type of demonstration are best done in the office.</p><p>There are other options where the pictures can be digitally sent into the office and morphed, but oftentimes, sent images are not of proper lighting, color or angle. The computer imaging is best done at the time of the consultation so that one can see their own individual results in addition to previous results that the surgeon has performed in his office Before-and-After book. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job and computer imaging</h3><p>I do not perform computer imaging in my office. I feel it gives a false sense of what is achieved and possibly an implied contract for the result. But I do spend a lot of time explaining what can be accomplished. Interestingly, to give you even a slight idea of what you can achieve to narrow the nose, a frontal view is best. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CLICK BELOW FOR WEB BASED COMPUTER IMAGING</h3><p>You can try your hand at computer imaging using the link below and uploading your own picture. The tools allow you to manipulate the image. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
