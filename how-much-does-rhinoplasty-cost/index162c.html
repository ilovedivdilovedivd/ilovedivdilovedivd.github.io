<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Rhinoplasty is a complex plastic surgery procedure which needs precise analysis and delicate surgery, each patient is different from the other patient, functional issues in addition to cosmetic concerns needs much more planing and time in the operating room. exact package pricing can be determined after clinic evaluation but in average it is in the range of 5-7k. (Ali Totonchi, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Cost</h3><p>Rhinoplasty typically costs from 7,000 to 10,000 dollars including the costs of anesthesia, operating room and surgeon’s fee.</p><p>Revision rhinopasty can cost more as it is more complex and fewer surgeons are expert in it. (Daniel G. Becker, MD, Voorhees Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty surgery prices vary widely</h3><p>The price for rhinoplasty typically includes the surgeon’s fee, facility and anesthesia fee, and all of the post-op care.</p><p>The price varies widely based on the extent of the rhinoplasty procedure, surgeon experience and market forces in each geographic area. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There is not a specific cost for rhinoplasty</h3><p>The rhinoplasty procedure can be very different from person to person depending on what has to be done and if the procedure is a first time rhinoplasty or a revision. A first time rhinoplasty typically costs around $6000 – $7000, and a revision may be $7000 – $9000 if you include the anesthesia.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_31" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>These numbers are only rough estimates and will vary in different regions of the country. In New York City or Beverly Hills the totals may be higher because the costs to run the practice and surgery center are significantly higher. The most important thing to look at is the experience of the surgeon.</p><p>We perform rhinoplasty every week which will allow us to provide more consistent results than a practice that only does it occasionally. It is important to see a lot of photos from the surgeon you are considering, and you should have trust and confidence in that person. If that is the case, the price is usually appropriate. (Andrew Miller, MD, Edison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Rhinoplasty Surgery</h3><p>Because no two people have the exact same nose or seek the very same treatment, it’s very difficult to put a cost on the price of a rhinoplasty before being able to examine a patient in person.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_33" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0bd9af67fa10f450931b6e2bee317cc2">

</div><p>The nose is an extremely delicate, prominent and important facial feature, which is why it’s important to enlist a rhinoplasty expert for any type of nose surgery. Before selecting your surgeon strictly based on price, researching their background, training, board certification, and asking to see before and after photos is a great idea.</p><p>Once you consult with a rhinoplasty expert, they will be able to give you an accurate and custom cost for your rhinoplasty. (Babak Azizzadeh, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rhinoplasty Costs</h3><p>Cost should not be the primary determinant for deciding on a rhinoplasty surgeon. However, I typically charge between $5000 and $10000, which is very reasonable, particularly for Los Angeles.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_32" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0095078f45e7c684458ac9d7a4c8e721">

</div><p>For some revisions, I may charge a little more. A huge factor in the cost is the length of time a rhinoplasty takes to complete. I may be able to perform cephalic trim, tip suturing, dorsal hump reduction, osteotomies, caudal septal reduction, and alar base reduction in 30 or 45 minutes, where another surgeon may take 3 hours.</p><p>Make sure the rhinoplasty surgeon has performed hundreds or thousands of rhinoplasties and has ELITE CREDENTIALS. (Kenneth B. Hughes, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What Does a Rhinoplasty Cost?</h3><p>In general, prices for rhinplasty vary by the geographic area, the surgeon’s expertise with the operation and whether it is a primary or secondary rhinoplasty. Younger surgeons just out of fellowship or residency often charge less. That makes sense. They want to get more experience. Fees in New York City and LA are usually higher than in Boston, Washingtion DC or Chicago.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_34" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>Surgeons like myself who have a passion for this operation and specialize in it tend to charge a bit more than surgeons who do the operation occassionally. And finally, revision (secondary) rhinoplasty can cost more becuase it is more difficulty.</p><p>That said, I think you should expect to pay about $6000 to $8000 plus the cost of anesthesia and OR charges for a primary rhinopasty and $8500- $12,000 plus those costs for a revision. Most active rhinoplastic surgeons do not charge to touch up their own rhinoplasties as long as you both agree on a plan that is reasonable, but that can vary with the surgeon.</p><p>What is most important, however, is the vibes you get from the surgeon about how he/she feels about fixing your nose and the vibes that you give back to the surgeon. Come to you consultation open minded and prepared to learn. The information you get off the internet prior to the consultation will help but not give you all you need to know.  (Stuart H. Bentkover, MD, Boston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Nose job cost</strong> varies by the part of the country in which you live, whether or not you live in a large city, suburbs or small town, the surgeon and what is needed for your nose. If your concerns are only functional, insurance may cover some of your costs, however it will not cover any cosmetic portion. Also, keep in mind that you will have a facility fee and anesthesia fee, so make sure you ask about those, as well. (Angela Sturm, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job cost Is Not Based on Surgeon’s Location, But On Surgeon’s Experience</h3><p>As you have probably gathered from other surgeons’ responses, nose job is considered to be the most technically as well as mentally challenging cosmetic surgical procedure performed. It is a true combination of art and science.</p><p>It is a balance of aesthetics (how it looks) and function (the ability to breath through it). It is a delicate balance between these two goals that a successful nose job is the result.No doubt a surgeons’ training is critical to have the foundation from which to begin a serious career in nose job surgery.</p><p>When surgical training has been examined by educators, repetition has been shown to be one of the most important factors during a surgeon’s training. It only makes sense; reading about it isn’t the same as doing it and then critically examining the results of one’s decisions and technical skill.</p><p>There is no hard and fast rule, but typically, on average, a surgeon that has an Ear, Nose, and Throat Residency, followed by a Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Fellowship pedigree will have been exposed to the most nose job’s during their formal surgical training years.</p><p>No doubt, the ultimate teacher of nose job is building on the foundation laid from the training years, with the crucial experience over the following years in practice.</p><p>To that end, nose job costs vary mostly upon on the surgeons experience and expertise. Another factor that influences cost is the degree of difficulty – no two noses are alike. Just look around you!</p><p>So the cost your friend paid to have their nose job done by a surgeon may be different for yours even if its the same surgeon.</p><p>What I tell my patients is you don’t want a surgeon fresh out of training that hasn’t been “around the block a couple times”, and you don’t want someone with so much experience that his technical skills are in decline.</p><p>I advise them they want someone who knows when to say yes, and more importantly when to say no, and doesn’t have a tremor i.e. someone that has done enough over time to see his own results, learn from them, and still be technically proficient.</p><p>Those surgeons will come at a higher price than someone who dabbles in nose job, but this is a structure you can’t put a sweater on it and hide it if it didn’t turn out quite right. Therefore, I advise patients to choose their nose job surgeon on the above first, not price.</p><p>Be aware, Revision Rhinoplasty is typically far more expensive (unless it is a tiny touch up) if the initial surgery didn’t come out right, and the pool of surgeons willing to take it on shrinks dramatically. It is not uncommon in some cases where the initial surgeon “burned a bridge” altering or removing tissue that makes the revision far more more complicated and unpredictable to the point where you are just hoping for improvement, not perfection. (Burke Robinson, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nose job costs Vary, but Other Factors More Important</h3><p>Nose job cost does vary considerably by surgeon and region, with a range of $5,000 to $15,000 for a primary rhinoplasty, including operating room and anesthesia costs.</p><p>Revision nose job is more difficult, and usually costs more than a primary nose job. More important than the cost is the skill and experience of the surgeon. Although intuitively, one might think that paying more predicts a better outcome, that is not necessarily true.</p><p>Cost should not be the primary determinant in choosing your surgeon. (Thomas A. Mustoe, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How Much Does nose job cost?</h3><p>Nose job fee depends on whether it is a primary or secondary surgery and whether a cartilage from the ear or rib will be needed. The complexity of the surgery also changes the anesthesia and the facility fees. (Bahman Guyuron, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
